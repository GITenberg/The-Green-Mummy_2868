    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE LOVERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I am very angry," pouted the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In heaven's name, why?" questioned the bachelor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have, so to speak, bought me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible: your price is prohibitive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, when a thousand pounds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are worth fifty and a hundred times as much. Pooh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That interjection doesn't answer my question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it is one which needs answering," said the young man
      lightly; "there are more important things to talk about than pounds,
      shillings, and sordid pence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed! Such as&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love, on a day such as this is. Look at the sky, blue as your eyes; at
      the sunshine, golden as your hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Warm as your affection, you should say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Affection! So cold a word, when I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the extent of one thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucy, you are a&mdash;woman. That money did not buy your love, but the
      consent of your step-father to our marriage. Had I not humored his whim,
      he would have insisted upon your marrying Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy pouted again and in scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if I ever would," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know. Random is a soldier and a baronet; handsome and
      agreeable, with a certain amount of talent. What objection can you find to
      such a match?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One insuperable objection; he isn't you, Archie&mdash;darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "H'm, the adjective appears to be an afterthought," grumbled the bachelor;
      then, when she merely laughed teasingly after the manner of women, he
      added moodily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by Jove, Random isn't me, by any manner of means. I am but a poor
      artist without fame or position, struggling on three hundred a year for a
      grudging recognition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite enough for one, you greedy creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for two?" he inquired softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! when I am engaged to you? Actions speak much louder than remarks,
      Mr. Archibald Hope. I love you more than I do money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angel! angel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said that I was a woman just now. What do, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," and he kissed her willing lips in the lane, which was empty save
      for blackbirds and beetles. "Is any explanation a clear one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to an angel, who requires adoration, but to a woman who&mdash;Let us
      walk on, Archie, or we shall be late for dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled and frowned and sighed and laughed in the space of
      thirty seconds&mdash;something of a feat in the way of emotional
      gymnastics. The freakish feminine nature perplexed him as it had perplexed
      Adam, and he could not understand this rapid change from poetry to prose.
      How could it be otherwise, when he was but five-and-twenty, and engaged
      for the first time? Threescore years and ten is all too short a time to
      learn what woman really is, and every student leaves this world with the
      conviction that of the thousand sides which the female of man presents to
      the male of woman, not one reveals the being he desires to know. There is
      always a deep below a deep; a veil behind a veil, a sphere within a
      sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's most remarkable," said the puzzled man in this instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is?" asked the enigma promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid an argument which he could not sustain, Archie switched his on to
      the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This day in September; one could well believe that it is still the month
      of roses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! With those wilted hedges and falling leaves and reaped fields and
      golden haystacks, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced around for further illustrations in the way of contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see all those things, dear, and the misplaced day also!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Misplaced?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "July day slipped into September. It comes into the landscape of this
      autumn month, as does love into the hearts of an elderly couple who feel
      too late the supreme passion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy's eyes swept the prospect, and the spring-like sunshine, revealing
      all too clearly the wrinkles of aging Nature, assisted her comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand. Yet youth has its wisdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And old age its experience. The law of compensation, my dearest. But I
      don't see," he added reflectively, "what your remark and my answer have to
      do with the view," whereat Lucy declared that his wits wandered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the last five minutes they had emerged from a sunken lane where the
      hedges were white with dust and dry with heat to a vast open space,
      apparently at the World's-End. Here the saltings spread raggedly towards
      the stately stream of the Thames, intersected by dykes and ditches, by
      earthen ramparts, crooked fences, sod walls, and irregular lines of
      stunted trees following the water-courses. The marshes were shaggy with
      reeds and rushes, and brown with coarse, fading herbage, although here and
      there gleamed emerald-hued patches of water-soaked soil, fit for
      fairy-rings. Beyond a moderately high embankment of turf and timber, the
      lovers could see the broad river, sweeping eastward to the Nore, with
      homeward-bound and outward-faring ships afloat on its golden tide. Across
      the gleaming waters, from where they lipped their banks to the foot of low
      domestic Kentish hills, stretched alluvial lands, sparsely timbered, and
      in the clear sunshine clusters of houses, great and small, factories with
      tall, smoky chimneys, clumps of trees and rigid railway lines could be
      discerned. The landscape was not beautiful, in spite of the sun's profuse
      gildings, but to the lovers it appeared a Paradise. Cupid, lord of gods
      and men, had bestowed on them the usual rose-colored spectacles which form
      an important part of his stock-in-trade, and they looked abroad on a fairy
      world. Was not SHE there: was not HE there: could Romeo or Juliet desire
      more?
    </p>
    <p>
      From their feet ran the slim, straight causeway, which was the King's
      highway of the district&mdash;a trim, prim line of white above the
      picturesque disorder of the marshes. It skirted the low-lying fields at
      the foot of the uplands and slipped through an iron gate to end in the far
      distance at the gigantic portal of The Fort. This was a squat, ungainly
      pile of rugged gray stone, symmetrically built, but aggressively ugly in
      its very regularity, since it insulted the graceful curves of Nature
      everywhere discernible. It stood nakedly amidst the bare, bleak meadows
      glittering with pools of still water, with not even the leaf of a creeper
      to soften its menacing walls, although above them appeared the
      full-foliaged tops of trees planted in the barrack-yard. It looked as
      though the grim walls belted a secret orchard. What with the frowning
      battlements, the very few windows diminutive and closely barred, the
      sullen entrance and the absence of any gracious greenery, Gartley Fort
      resembled the Castle of Giant Despair. On the hither side, but invisible
      to the lovers, great cannons scowled on the river they protected, and,
      when they spoke, received answer from smaller guns across the stream.
      There less extensive forts were concealed amidst trees and masked by turf
      embankments, to watch and guard the golden argosies of London commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, always impressionable, shivered with her hand in that of Archie's,
      as she stared at the landscape, melancholy even in the brilliant sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should hate to live in Gartley Fort," said she abruptly. "One might as
      well be in jail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you marry Random you will have to live there, or on a baggage wagon.
      He is R.G.A. captain, remember, and has to go where glory calls him, like
      a good soldier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glory can call until glory is hoarse for me," retorted the girl candidly.
      "I prefer an artist's studio to a camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Hope, laughing at her vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reason is obvious. I love the artist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you loved the soldier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should mount the baggage wagon and make him Bovril when he was wounded.
      But for you, dear, I shall cook and sew and bake and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop! stop! I want a wife, not a housekeeper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every sensible man wants the two in one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you should be a queen, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not with my own consent, Archie: the work is much too hard. Existence on
      six pounds a week with you will be more amusing. We can take a cottage,
      you know, and live, the simple life in Gartley village, until you become
      the P.R.A., and I can be Lady Hope, to walk in silk attire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall be Queen of the Earth, darling, and walk alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dull! I would much rather walk with you. And that reminds me that
      dinner is waiting. Let us take the short cut home through the village. On
      the way you can tell me exactly how you bought me from my step-father for
      one thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie Hope frowned at the incurable obstinacy of the sex. "I didn't buy
      you, dearest: how many times do you wish me to deny a sale which never
      took place? I merely obtained your step-father's consent to our marriage
      in the near future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if he had anything to do with my marriage, being only my step-father,
      and having, in my eyes, no authority. In what way did you get his consent&mdash;his
      unnecessary consent," she repeated with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was waste of breath to argue with a woman who had made up her
      mind. The two began to walk towards the village along the causeway, and
      Hope cleared his throat to explain&mdash;patiently as to a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that your step-father&mdash;Professor Braddock&mdash;is crazy on
      the subject of mummies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy nodded in her pretty wilful way. "He is an Egyptologist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, but less famous and rich than he should be, considering his
      knowledge of dry-as-dust antiquities. Well, then, to make a long story
      short, he told me that he greatly desired to examine into the difference
      between the Egyptians and the Peruvians, with regard to the embalming of
      the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always thought that he was too fond of Egypt to bother about any other
      country," said Lucy sapiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, it isn't the country he cares about, but the civilization of the
      past. The Incas embalmed their dead, as did the Egyptians, and in some way
      the Professor heard of a Royal Mummy, swathed in green bandages&mdash;so
      he described it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It should be called an Irish mummy," said Lucy flippantly. "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This mummy is in possession of a man at Malta, and Professor Braddock,
      hearing that it was for sale for one thousand pounds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" interrupted the girl vivaciously, "so this was why father sent
      Sidney Bolton away six weeks ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. As you know, Bolton is your step-father's assistant, and is as crazy
      as the Professor on the subject of Egypt. I asked the Professor if he
      would allow me to marry you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite unnecessary," interpolated Lucy briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie passed over the remark to evade an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I asked him, he said that he wished you to marry Random, who is
      rich. I pointed out that you loved me and not Random, and that Random was
      on a yachting cruise, while I was on the spot. He then said that he could
      not wait for the return of Random, and would give me a chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it seems that he was in a hurry to get this Green Mummy from Malta,
      as he feared lest some other person should snap it up. This was two months
      ago, remember, and Professor Braddock wanted the cash at once. Had Random
      been here he could have supplied it, but as Random was away he told me
      that if I handed over one thousand pounds to purchase the mummy, that he
      would permit our engagement now, and our marriage in six months. I saw my
      chance and took it, for your step-father has always been an obstacle in
      our path, Lucy, dear. In a week Professor Braddock had the money, as I
      sold out some of my investments to get it. He then sent Bolton to Malta in
      a tramp steamer for the sake of cheapness, and now expects him back with
      the Green Mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Sidney bought it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He got it for nine hundred pounds, the Professor told me, and is
      bringing it back in The Diver&mdash;that's the same tramp steamer in which
      he went to Malta. So that's the whole story, and you can see there is no
      question of you being bought. The thousand pounds went to get your
      father's consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not my father," snapped Lucy, finding nothing else to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You call him so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is only from habit. I can't call him Mr. Braddock, or Professor
      Braddock, when I live with him, so `father' is the sole mode of address
      left to me. And after all," she added, taking her lover's arm, "I like the
      Professor; he is very kind and good, although extremely absent-minded. And
      I am glad he has consented, for he worried me a lot to marry Sir Frank
      Random. I am glad you bought me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I didn't," cried the exasperated lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you did, and you shouldn't have diminished your income by buying
      what you could have had for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie shrugged his shoulders. It was vain to combat her fixed idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have still three hundred a year left. And you were worth buying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no right to talk of me as though I had been bought."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man gasped. "But you said&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what does it matter what I said. I am going to marry you on three
      hundred a year, so there it is. I suppose when Bolton returns, my father
      will be glad to see the back of me, and then will go to Egypt with Sidney
      to explore this secret tomb he is always talking about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That expedition will require more than a thousand pounds," said Archie
      dryly. "The Professor explained the obstacles to me. However, his doings
      have nothing to do with us, darling. Let Professor Braddock fumble amongst
      the dead if he likes. We live!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apart," sighed Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only for the next six months; then we can get our cottage and live on
      love, my dearest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plus three hundred a year," said the girl sensibly then she added, "Oh,
      poor Frank Random!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucy," cried her lover indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I was only pitying him. He's a nice man, and you can't expect him
      to be pleased at our marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Hope in an icy tone, "you would like him to be the
      bridegroom. If so, there is still time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly boy!" She took his arm. "As I have been bought, you know that I
      can't run away from my purchaser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You denied being bought just now. It seems to me, Lucy, that I am to
      marry a weather-cock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is only an impolite name for a woman, dear. You have no sense of
      humor, Frank, or you would call me an April lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you change every five minutes. H'm! It's puzzling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it? Perhaps you would like me to resemble Widow Anne, who is always
      funereal. Here she is, looking like Niobe."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were strolling through Gartley village by this time, and the
      cottagers came to their doors and front gates to look at the handsome
      young couple. Everyone knew of the engagement, and approved of the same,
      although some hinted that Lucy Kendal would have been wiser to marry the
      soldier-baronet. Amongst these was Widow Anne, who really was Mrs. Bolton,
      the mother of Sidney, a dismal female invariably arrayed in rusty, stuffy,
      aggressive mourning, although her husband had been dead for over twenty
      years. Because of this same mourning, and because she was always talking
      of the dead, she was called "Widow Anne," and looked on the appellation as
      a compliment to her fidelity. At the present moment she stood at the gate
      of her tiny garden, mopping her red eyes with a dingy handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, young love, young love, my lady," she groaned, when the couple
      passed, for she always gave Lucy a title as though she really and truly
      had become the wife of Sir Frank, "but who knows how long it may last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As long as we do," retorted Lucy, annoyed by this prophetic speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow Anne groaned with relish. "So me and Aaron, as is dead and gone,
      thought, my lady. But in six months he was knocking the head off me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who would lay his hand on a woman save in the way of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Archie, what nonsense, you talk!" cried Miss Kendal pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" sighed the woman of experience, "I called it nonsense too, my lady,
      afore Aaron, who now lies with the worms, laid me out with a flat-iron.
      Men's fit for jails only, as I allays says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nice opinion you have of our sex," remarked Archie dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, sir. I could tell you things as would make your head waggle with
      horror on there shoulders of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about your son Sidney? Is he also wicked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would be if he had the strength, which he hasn't," exclaimed the widow
      with uncomplimentary fervor. "He's Aaron's son, and Aaron hadn't much to
      learn from them as is where he's gone too," and she looked downward
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sidney is a decent young fellow," said Lucy sharply. "How dare you
      miscall your own flesh and blood, Widow Anne? My father thinks a great
      deal of Sidney, else he would not have sent him to Malta. Do try and be
      cheerful, there's a good soul. Sidney will tell you plenty to make you
      laugh, when he comes home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he ever does come home," sighed the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's all very well asking questions as can't be answered nohow, my
      lady, but I be all of a mubble-fubble, that I be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is a mubble-fubble?" asked Hope, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a queer-like feeling of death and sorrow and tears of blood and not
      lifting your head for groans," said Widow Anne incoherently, "and there's
      meanings in mubble-fumbles, as we're told in Scripture. Not but what the
      Perfesser's been a kind gentleman to Sid in taking him from going round
      with the laundry cart, and eddicating him to watch camphorated corpses:
      not as what I'd like to keep an eye on them things myself. But there's no
      more watching for my boy Sid, as I dreamed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you dream?" asked Lucy curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow Anne threw up two gnarled hands, wrinkled with age and laundry work,
      screwing up her face meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dreamed of battle and murder and sudden death, my lady, with Sid in his
      cold grave playing on a harp, angel-like. Yes!" she folded her rusty shawl
      tightly round her spare form and nodded, "there was Sid, looking beautiful
      in his coffin, and cut into a hash, as you might say, with&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh! ugh!" shuddered Lucy, and Archie strove to draw her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With murder written all over his poor face," pursued the widow. "And I
      woke up screeching with cramp in my legs and pains in my lungs, and
      beatings in my heart, and stiffness in my&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hang it, shut up!" shouted Archie, seeing that Lucy was growing pale
      at this ghoulish recital, "don't be fool, woman. Professor Braddock says
      that Bolton'll be back in three days with the mummy he has been sent to
      fetch from Malta. You have been having nightmare! Don't you see how you
      are frightening Miss Kendal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The Witch' of Endor, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deuce take the Witch of Endor and you also. There's a shilling. Go and
      drink yourself into a more cheery frame of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow Anne bit the shilling with one of her two remaining teeth, and
      dropped a curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a good, kind gentleman," she smirked, cheered at the idea of
      unlimited gin. "And when my boy Sid do come home a corpse, I hope you'll
      come to the funeral, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a raven!" said Lucy, as Widow Anne toddled away in the direction of
      the one public-house in Gartley village.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wonder that the late Mr. Bolton laid her out with a flat-iron. To
      slay such a woman would be meritorious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder how she came to be the mother of Sidney," said Miss Kendal
      reflectively, as they resumed their walk, "he's such a clever, smart, and
      handsome young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Bolton owes everything to the Professor's teaching and example,
      Lucy," replied her lover. "He was an uncouth lad, I understand, when your
      step-father took him into the house six years ago. Now he is quite
      presentable. I shouldn't wonder if he married Mrs. Jasher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "H'm! I rather think Mrs. Jasher admires the Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he'll never marry her. If she were a mummy there might be a chance,
      of course, but as a human being the Professor will never look at her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know so much about that, Archie. Mrs. Jasher is attractive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope laughed. "In a mutton-dressed-as-lamb way, no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she has money. My father is poor and so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make up a match at once, as every woman will do. Well, let us get
      back to the Pyramids, and see how the flirtation is progressing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy walked on for a few steps in silence. "Do you believe in Mrs.
      Bolton's dream, Archie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I believe she eats heavy suppers. Bolton will return quite safe; he
      is a clever fellow, not easily taken advantage of. Don't bother any more
      about Widow Anne and her dismal prophecies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try not to," replied Lucy dutifully. "All the same, I wish she had
      not told me her dream," and she shivered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. PROFESSOR BRADDOCK
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was only one really palatial mansion in Gartley, and that was the
      ancient Georgian house known as the Pyramids. Lucy's step-father had given
      the place this eccentric name on taking up his abode there some ten years
      previously. Before that time the dwelling had been occupied by the Lord of
      the Manor and his family. But now the old squire was dead, and his
      impecunious children were scattered to the four quarters of the globe in
      search of money with which to rebuild their ruined fortunes. As the
      village was somewhat isolated and rather unhealthily situated in a marshy
      country, the huge, roomy old Grange had not been easy to let, and had
      proved quite impossible to sell. Under these disastrous circumstances,
      Professor Braddock&mdash;who described himself humorously as a scientific
      pauper&mdash;had obtained the tenancy at a ridiculously low rental, much
      to his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people would have paid money to avoid exile in these damp waste
      lands, which, as it were, fringed civilization, but their loneliness and
      desolation suited the Professor exactly. He required ample room for his
      Egyptian collection, with plenty of time to decipher hieroglyphics and
      study perished dynasties of the Nile Valley. The world of the present day
      did not interest Braddock in the least. He lived almost continuously on
      that portion of the mental plane which had to do with the far-distant
      past, and only concerned himself with physical existence, when it
      consisted of mummies and mystic beetles, sepulchral ornaments, pictured
      documents, hawk-headed deities and suchlike things of almost inconceivable
      antiquity. He rarely walked abroad and was invariably late for meals, save
      when he missed any particular one altogether, which happened frequently.
      Absent-minded in conversation, untidy in dress, unpractical in business,
      dreamy in manner, Professor Braddock lived solely for archaeology. That
      such a man should have taken to himself a wife was mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had been married fifteen years before to a widow, who possessed a
      limited income and one small child. It was the opportunity of securing the
      use of a steady income which had decoyed Braddock into the matrimonial
      snare of Mrs. Kendal. To put it plainly, he had married the agreeable
      widow for her money, although he could scarcely be called a
      fortune-hunter. Like Eugene Aram, he desired cash to assist learning, and
      as that scholar had committed murder to secure what he wanted, so did the
      Professor marry to obtain his ends. These were to have someone to manage
      the house, and to be set free from the necessity of earning his bread, so
      that he might indulge in pursuits more pleasurable than money-making. Mrs.
      Kendal was a placid, phlegmatic lady, who liked rather than loved the
      Professor, and who desired him more as a companion than as a husband. With
      Braddock she did not arrange a romantic marriage so much as enter into a
      congenial partnership. She wanted a man in the house, and he desired
      freedom from pecuniary embarrassment. On these lines the prosaic bargain
      was struck, and Mrs. Kendal became the Professor's wife with entirely
      successful results. She gave her husband a home, and her child a father,
      who became fond of Lucy, and who&mdash;considering he was merely an
      amateur parent&mdash;acted admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this sensible partnership lasted only for five years. Mrs. Braddock
      died of a chill on the liver and left her five hundred a year to the
      Professor for life, with remainder to Lucy, then a small girl of ten. It
      was at this critical moment that Braddock became a practical man for the
      first and last time in his dreamy life. He buried his wife with unfeigned
      regret&mdash;for he had been sincerely attached to her in his
      absent-minded way&mdash;and sent Lucy to a Hampstead boarding school.
      After an interview with his late wife's lawyer to see that the income was
      safe, he sought for a house in the country, and quickly discovered Gartley
      Grange, which no one would take because of its isolation. Within three
      months from the burial of Mrs. Braddock, the widower had removed himself
      and his collection to Gartley, and had renamed his new abode the Pyramids.
      Here he dwelt quietly and enjoyably&mdash;from his dry-as-dust point of
      view&mdash;for ten years, and here Lucy Kendal had come when her education
      was completed. The arrival of a marriageable young lady made no difference
      in the Professor's habits, and he hailed her thankfully as the successor
      to her mother in managing the small establishment. It is to be feared that
      Braddock was somewhat selfish in his views, but the fixed idea of
      archaeological research made him egotistical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mansion was three-story, flat-roofed, extremely ugly and unexpectedly
      comfortable. Built of mellow red brick with dingy white stone facings, it
      stood a few yards back from the roadway which ran from Gartley Fort
      through the village, and, at the precise point where the Pyramids was
      situated, curved abruptly through woodlands to terminate a mile away, at
      Jessum, the local station of the Thames Railway Line. An iron railing,
      embedded in moldering stone work, divided the narrow front garden from the
      road, and on either side of the door&mdash;which could be reached by five
      shallow steps&mdash;grew two small yew trees, smartly clipped and trimmed
      into cones of dull green. These yews possessed some magical significance,
      which Professor Braddock would occasionally explain to chance visitors
      interested in occult matters; for, amongst other things Egyptian, the
      archaeologist searched into the magic of the Sons of Khem, and insisted
      that there was more truth than superstition in their enchantments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock used all the vast rooms of the ground floor to house his
      collection of antiquities, which he had acquired through many laborious
      years. He dwelt entirely in this museum, as his bedroom adjoined his
      study, and he frequently devoured his hurried meals amongst the
      brilliantly tinted mummy cases. The embalmed dead populated his world, and
      only now and then, when Lucy insisted, did he ascend to the first floor,
      which was her particular abode. Here was the drawing-room, the dining-room
      and Lucy's boudoir; here also were sundry bedrooms, furnished and
      unfurnished, in one of which Miss Kendal slept, while the others remained
      vacant for chance visitors, principally from the scientific world. The
      third story was devoted to the cook, her husband&mdash;who acted as
      gardener&mdash;and to the house parlor maid, a composite domestic, who
      worked from morning until night in keeping the great house clean. During
      the day these servants attended to their business in a comfortable
      basement, where the cook ruled supreme. At the back of the mansion
      stretched a fairly large kitchen garden, to which the cook's husband
      devoted his attention. This was the entire domain belonging to the tenant,
      as, of course, the Professor did not rent the arable acres and comfortable
      farms which had belonged to the dispossessed family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in the house went smoothly, as Lucy was a methodical young
      person, who went by the clock and the almanac. Braddock little knew how
      much of his undeniable comfort he owed to her fostering care; for, prior
      to her return from school, he had been robbed right and left by
      unscrupulous domestics. When his step-daughter arrived he simply handed
      over the keys and the housekeeping money&mdash;a fixed sum&mdash;and gave
      her strict instructions not to bother him. Miss Kendal faithfully observed
      this injunction, as she enjoyed being undisputed mistress, and knew that,
      so long as her step-father had his meals, his bed, his bath and his
      clothes, he required nothing save the constant society of his beloved
      mummies, of which no one wished to deprive him. These he dusted and
      cleansed and rearranged himself. Not even Lucy dared to invade the museum,
      and the mere mention of spring cleaning drove the Professor into
      displaying frantic rage, in which he used bad language.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning from her walk with Archie, the girl had lured her step-father
      into assuming a rusty dress suit, which had done service for many years,
      and had coaxed him into a promise to be present at dinner. Mrs. Jasher,
      the lively widow of the district, was coming, and Braddock approved of a
      woman who looked up to him as the one wise man in the world. Even science
      is susceptible to judicious flattery, and Mrs. Jasher was never backward
      in putting her admiration into words. Female gossip declared that the
      widow wished to become the second Mrs. Braddock, but if this was really
      the case, she had but small chance of gaining her end. The Professor had
      once sacrificed his liberty to secure a competence, and, having acquired
      five hundred a year, was not inclined for a second matrimonial venture.
      Had the widow been a dollar heiress with a million at her back he would
      not have troubled to place a ring on her finger. And certainly Mrs. Jasher
      had little to gain from such a dreary marriage, beyond a collection of
      rubbish&mdash;as she said&mdash;and a dull country house situated in a
      district inhabited solely by peasants belonging to Saxon times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie Hope left Lucy at the door of the Pyramids and repaired to his
      village lodgings, for the purpose of assuming evening dress. Lucy, being
      her own housekeeper, assisted the overworked parlor maid to lay and
      decorate the table before receiving the guests. Thus Mrs. Jasher found no
      one in the drawing-room to welcome her, and, taking the privilege of old
      friendship, descended to beard Braddock in his den. The Professor raised
      his eyes from a newly bought scarabeus to behold a stout little lady
      smiling on him from the doorway. He did not appear to be grateful for the
      interruption, but Mrs. Jasher was not at all dismayed, being a man-hunter
      by profession. Besides, she saw that Braddock was in the clouds as usual,
      and would have received the King himself in the same absent-minded manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pouf! what an abominal smell!" exclaimed the widow, holding a flimsy lace
      handkerchief to her nose. "Kind of camphor-sandal-wood charnel-house
      smell. I wonder you are not asphyxiated. Pouf! Ugh! Bur-r-r
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor stared at her with cold, fishy eyes. "Did you speak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear me, yes, and you don't even ask me to take a chair. If I were a
      nasty stuffy mummy, now, you would be embracing me by, this time. Don't
      you know that I have come to dinner, you silly man?" and she tapped him
      playfully with her closed fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had dinner," said Braddock, egotistic as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you have not." Mrs. Jasher spoke positively, and pointed to a small
      tray of untouched food on the side table. "You have not even had luncheon.
      You must live on air, like a chameleon&mdash;or on love, perhaps," she
      ended in a significantly tender tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she might as well have spoken to the granite image of Horus in the
      corner. Braddock merely rubbed his chin and stared harder than ever at the
      glittering visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me!" he said innocently. "I must have forgotten to eat. Lamplight!"
      he looked round vaguely. "Of course, I remember lighting the lamps. Time
      has gone by very rapidly. I am really hungry." He paused to make sure,
      then repeated his remark in a more positive manner. "Yes, I am very
      hungry, Mrs. Jasher." He looked at her as though she had just entered. "Of
      course, Mrs. Jasher. Do you wish to see me about anything particular?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow frowned at his inattention, and then laughed. It was impossible
      to be angry with this dreamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to dinner, Professor. Do try and wake up; you are half asleep
      and half starved, too, I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly feel unaccountably hungry," admitted Braddock cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unaccountably, when you have eaten nothing since breakfast. You weird
      man, I believe you are a mummy yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Professor had again returned to examine the scarabeus, this time
      with a powerful magnifying glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It certainly belongs to the twentieth dynasty," he murmured, wrinkling
      his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher stamped and flirted her fan pettishly. The creature's soul,
      she decided, was certainly not in his body, and until it came back he
      would continue to ignore her. With the annoyance of a woman who is not
      getting her own way, she leaned back in Braddock's one comfortable chair&mdash;which
      she had unerringly selected&mdash;and examined him intently. Perhaps the
      gossips were correct, and she was trying to imagine what kind of a husband
      he would make. But whatever might be her thoughts, she eyed Braddock as
      earnestly as Braddock eyed the scarabeus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly the Professor did not appear like the savant he was reported to
      be. He was small of stature, plump of body, rosy as a little Cupid, and
      extraordinarily youthful, considering his fifty-odd years of scientific
      wear and tear. With a smooth, clean-shaven face, plentiful white hair like
      spun silk, and neat feet and hands, he did not look his age. The dreamy
      look in his small blue eyes was rather belied by the hardness of his
      thin-lipped mouth, and by the pugnacious push of his jaw. The eyes and the
      dome-like forehead hinted that brain without much originality; but the
      lower part of this contradictory countenance might have belonged to a
      prize-fighter. Nevertheless, Braddock's plumpness did away to a
      considerable extent with his aggressive look. It was certainly latent, but
      only came to the surface when he fought with a brother savant over some
      tomb-dweller from Thebes. In the soft lamplight he looked like a fighting
      cherub, and it was a pity&mdash;in the interests of art&mdash;that the
      hairless pink and white face did not surmount a pair of wings rather than
      a rusty and ill-fitting dress suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's nane sa dafty as he looks," thought Mrs. Jasher, who was Scotch,
      although she claimed to be cosmopolitan. "With his mummies he is all
      right, but outside those he might be difficult to manage. And these
      things," she glanced round the shadowy room, crowded with the dead and
      their earthly belongings. "I don't think I would care to marry the British
      Museum. Too much like hard work, and I am not so young as I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      The near mirror&mdash;a polished silver one, which had belonged, ages ago,
      to some coquette of Memphis&mdash;denied this uncomplimentary thought, for
      Mrs. Jasher did not look a day over thirty, although her birth certificate
      set her down as forty-five. In the lamplight she might have passed for
      even younger, so carefully had she preserved what remained to her of
      youth. She assuredly was somewhat stout, and never had been so tall as she
      desired to be. But the lines of her plump figure were still discernible in
      the cunningly cut gown, and she carried her little self with such mighty
      dignity that people overlooked the mortifying height of a trifle over five
      feet. Her features were small and neat, but her large blue eyes were so
      noticeable and melting that those on whom she turned them ignored the lack
      of boldness in chin and nose. Her hair was brown and arranged in the
      latest fashion, while her complexion was so fresh and pink that, if she
      did paint&mdash;as jealous women averred&mdash;she must have been quite an
      artist with the hare's foot and the rouge pot and the necessary powder
      puff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher's clothes repaid the thought she expended upon them, and she
      was artistic in this as in other things. Dressed in a crocus-yellow gown,
      with short sleeves to reveal her beautiful arms, and cut low to display
      her splendid bust, she looked perfectly dressed. A woman would have
      declared the wide-netted black lace with which the dress was draped to be
      cheap, and would have hinted that the widow wore too many jewels in her
      hair, on her corsage, round her arms, and ridiculously gaudy rings on her
      fingers. This might have been true, for Mrs. Jasher sparkled like the
      Milky Way at every movement; but the gleam of gold and the flash of gems
      seemed to suit her opulent beauty. Her slightest movement wafted around
      her a strange Chinese perfume, which she obtained&mdash;so she said&mdash;from
      a friend of her late husband's who was in the British Embassy at Pekin. No
      one possessed this especial perfume but Mrs. Jasher, and anyone who had
      previously met her, meeting her in the darkness, could have guessed at her
      identity. With a smile to show her white teeth, with her golden-hued dress
      and glittering jewels, the pretty widow glowed in that glimmering room
      like a tropical bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor raised his dreamy eyes and laid the beetle on one side, when
      his brain fully grasped that this charming vision was waiting to be
      entertained. She was better to look upon even than the beloved scarabeus,
      and he advanced to shake hands as though she had just entered the room.
      Mrs. Jasher&mdash;knowing his ways&mdash;rose to extend her hand, and the
      two small, stout figures looked absurdly like a pair of chubby Dresden
      ornaments which had stepped from the mantelshelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear lady, I am glad to see you. You have&mdash;you have"&mdash;the
      Professor reflected, and then came back with a rush to the present century&mdash;"you
      have come to dinner, if I mistake not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucy asked me a week ago," she replied tartly, for no woman likes to be
      neglected for a mere beetle, however ancient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will certainly get a good dinner," said Braddock, waving his
      plump white hands. "Lucy is an excellent housekeeper. I have no fault to
      find with her&mdash;no fault at all. But she is obstinate&mdash;oh, very
      obstinate, as her mother was. Do you know, dear lady, that in a papyrus
      scroll which I lately acquired I found the recipe for a genuine Egyptian
      dish, which Amenemha&mdash;the last Pharaoh of the eleventh dynasty, you
      know&mdash;might have eaten, and probably did eat. I desired Lucy to serve
      it to-night, but she refused, much to my annoyance. The ingredients, which
      had to do with roasted gazelle, were oil and coriander seed and&mdash;if
      my memory serves me&mdash;asafoetida."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh!" Mrs. Jasher's handkerchief went again to her mouth. "Say no more,
      Professor; your dish sounds horrid. I don't wish to eat it, and be turned
      into a mummy before my time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would make a really beautiful mummy," said Braddock, paying what he
      conceived was a compliment; "and, should you die, I shall certainly attend
      to your embalming, if you prefer that to cremation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dreadful man!" cried the widow, turning pale and shrinking. "Why, I
      really believe that you would like to see me packed away in one of those
      disgusting coffins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disgusting!" cried the outraged Professor, striking one of the
      brilliantly tinted cases. "Can you call so beautiful a specimen of
      sepulchral art disgusting? Look at the colors, at the regularity of the
      hieroglyphics&mdash;why, the history of the dead is set out in this
      magnificent series of pictures." He adjusted his pince-nez and began to
      read, "The Osirian, Scemiophis that is a female name, Mrs. Jasher&mdash;who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to have my history written on my coffin," interrupted the
      widow hysterically, for this funereal talk frightened her. "It would take
      much more space than a mummy case upon which to write it. My life has been
      volcanic, I can tell you. By the way," she added hurriedly, seeing that
      Braddock was on the eve of resuming the reading, "tell me about your Inca
      mummy. Has it arrived?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor immediately followed the false trail. "Not yet," he said
      briskly, rubbing his smooth hands, "but in three days I expect The Diver
      will be at Pierside, and Sidney will bring the mummy on here. I shall
      unpack it at once and learn exactly how the ancient Peruvians embalmed
      their dead. Doubtless they learned the art from&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Egyptians," ventured Mrs. Jasher rashly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock glared. "Nothing of the sort, dear lady," he snorted angrily.
      "Absurd, ridiculous! I am inclined to believe that Egypt was merely a
      colony of that vast island of Atlantis mentioned by Plato. There&mdash;if
      my theory is correct&mdash;civilization begun, and the kings of Atlantis&mdash;doubtless
      the gods of historical tribes&mdash;governed the whole world, including
      that portion which we now term South America."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say that there were Yankees in those days?" inquired Mrs.
      Jasher frivolously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor tucked his hands under his shabby coattails and strode up
      and down the room warming his rage, which was provoked by such ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens, madam, where have you lived?" he exclaimed explosively&mdash;"are
      you a fool, or merely an ignorant woman? I am talking of prehistoric
      times, thousands of years ago, when you were probably a stray atom
      embedded in the slime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you horrid creature!" cried Mrs. Jasher indignantly, and was about to
      give Braddock her opinion, if only to show him that she could hold her
      own, when the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Mrs. Jasher?" said Lucy, advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here am I and here is Archie. Dinner is ready. And you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very hungry," said Mrs. Jasher. "I have been called an atom of the
      slime," then she laughed and took possession of young Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy wrinkled her brow; she did not approve of the widow's man-annexing
      instinct.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. A MYSTERIOUS TOMB
    </h2>
    <p>
      One member of the Braddock household was not included in the general
      staff, being a mere appendage of the Professor himself. This was a
      dwarfish, misshapen Kanaka, a pigmy in height, but a giant in breadth,
      with short, thick legs, and long, powerful arms. He had a large head, and
      a somewhat handsome face, with melancholy black eyes and a fine set of
      white teeth. Like most Polynesians, his skin was of a pale bronze and
      elaborately tattooed, even the cheeks and chin being scored with curves
      and straight lines of mystical import. But the most noticeable thing about
      him was his huge mop of frizzled hair, which, by some process, known only
      to himself, he usually dyed a vivid yellow. The flaring locks streaming
      from his head made him resemble a Peruvian image of the sun, and it was
      this peculiar coiffure which had procured for him the odd name of
      Cockatoo. The fact that this grotesque creature invariably wore a white
      drill suit, emphasized still more the suggestion of his likeness to an
      Australian parrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cockatoo had come from the Solomon Islands in his teens to the colony of
      Queensland, to work on the plantations, and there the Professor had picked
      him up as his body servant. When Braddock returned to marry Mrs. Kendal,
      the boy had refused to leave him, although it was represented to the young
      savage that he was somewhat too barbaric for sober England. Finally, the
      Professor had consented to bring him over seas, and had never regretted
      doing so, for Cockatoo, finding his scientific master a true friend,
      worshipped him as a visible god. Having been captured when young by
      Pacific black-birders, he talked excellent English, and from contact with
      the necessary restraints of civilization was, on the whole, extremely well
      behaved. Occasionally, when teased by the villagers and his
      fellow-servants, he would break into childish rages, which bordered on the
      dangerous. But a word from Braddock always quieted him, and when penitent
      he would crawl like a whipped dog to the feet of his divinity. For the
      most part he lived entirely in the museum, looking after the collection
      and guarding it from harm. Lucy&mdash;who had a horror of the creature's
      uncanny looks&mdash;objected to Cockatoo waiting at the table, and it was
      only on rare occasions that he was permitted to assist the harassed
      parlormaid. On this night the Kanaka acted excellently as a butler, and
      crept softly round the table, attending to the needs of the diners. He was
      an admirable servant, deft and handy, but his blue-lined face and squat
      figure together with the obtrusively golden halo, rather worried Mrs.
      Jasher. And, indeed, in spite of custom, Lucy also felt uncomfortable when
      this gnome hovered at her elbow. It looked as though one of the
      fantastical idols from the museum below had come to haunt the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not like that Golliwog," breathed Mrs. Jasher to her host, when
      Cockatoo was at the sideboard. "He gives me the creeps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Imagination, my dear lady, pure imagination. Why should we not have a
      picturesque animal to wait upon us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would wait picturesquely enough at a cannibal feast," suggested
      Archie, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't!" murmured Lucy, with a shiver. "I shall not be able to eat my
      dinner if you talk so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Odd that Hope should say what he has said," observed Braddock confidently
      to the widow. "Cockatoo comes from a cannibal island, and doubtless has
      seen the consumption of human flesh. No, no, my dear lady, do not look so
      alarmed. I don't think he has eaten any, as he was taken to Queensland
      long before he could participate in such banquets. He is a very decent
      animal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very dangerous one, I fancy," retorted Mrs. Jasher, who looked pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only when he loses his temper, and I'm always able to suppress that when
      it is at its worst. You are not eating your meat, my dear lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you wonder at it, and you talk of cannibals?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us change the conversation to cereals," suggested Hope, whose
      appetite was of the best&mdash;"wheat, for instance. In this queer little
      village I notice the houses are divided by a field of wheat. It seems
      wrong somehow for corn to be bunched up with houses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's old Farmer Jenkins," said Lucy vivaciously; "he owns three or four
      acres near the public-house and will not allow them to be built over,
      although he has been offered a lot of money. I noticed myself, Archie, the
      oddity of finding a cornfield surrounded by cottages. It's like Alice in
      Wonderland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But fancy any one offering money for land here," observed Hope, toying
      with his claret glass, which had just been refilled, by the attentive
      Cockatoo, "at the Back-of-Beyond, as it were. I shouldn't care to live
      here&mdash;the neighborhood is so desolate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same you do live here!" interposed Mrs. Jasher smartly, and with
      a roguish glance at Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie caught the glance and saw the blush on Miss Kendal's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have answered your question yourself, Mrs. Jasher," he&mdash;said,
      smiling. "I have the inducement you hint at to remain here, and certainly,
      as a landscape painter, I admire the marshes and sunsets. As an artist and
      an engaged man I stop in Gartley, otherwise I should clear out. But I fail
      to see why a lady of your attractions should&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may have a sentimental reason also," interrupted the widow, with a sly
      glance at the absent-minded Professor, who was drawing hieroglyphics on
      the table-cloth with a fork; "also, my cottage is cheap and very
      comfortable. The late Mr. Jasher did not leave me sufficient money to live
      in London. He was a consul in China, you know, and consuls are never very
      well paid. I will come in for a large income, however."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," said Lucy politely, and wondering why Mrs. Jasher was so
      communicative. "Soon I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be very soon. My brother, you know&mdash;a merchant in Pekin. He
      has come home to die, and is unmarried. When he does die, I shall go to
      London. But," added the widow, meditatively and glancing again at the
      Professor, "I shall be sorry to leave dear Gartley. Still, the memory of
      happy hours spent in this house will always remain with me. Ah me! ah me!"
      and she put her handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy telegraphed to Archie that the widow was a humbug, and Archie
      telegraphed back that he quite agreed with her. But the Professor, whom
      the momentary silence had brought back to the present century, looked up
      and asked Lucy if the dinner was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to do some work this evening," said the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, father, when you said that you would take a holiday," said Lucy
      reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am doing so now. Look at the precious minutes I am wasting in eating,
      my dear. Life is short and much remains to be done in the way of Egyptian
      exploration. There is the sepulchre of Queen Tahoser. If I could only
      enter that," and he sighed, while helping himself to cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you?" asked Mrs. Jasher, who was beginning to give up her
      pursuit of Braddock, for it was no use wooing a man whose interests
      centered entirely in Egyptian tombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have yet to discover it," said the Professor simply; then, warming to
      the congenial theme, he glanced around and delivered a short historical
      lecture. "Tahoser was the chief wife and queen of a famous Pharaoh&mdash;the
      Pharaoh of the Exodus, in fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one who was drowned in the Red Sea?" asked Archie idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes&mdash;but that happened later. Before pursuing the Hebrews,&mdash;if
      the Mosaic account is to be believed,&mdash;this Pharaoh marched far into
      the interior of Africa,&mdash;the Libya of the ancients,&mdash;and
      conquered the natives of Upper Ethiopia. Being deeply in love with his
      queen, he took her with him on this expedition, and she died before the
      Pharaoh returned to Memphis. From records which I discovered in the museum
      of Cairo, I have reason to believe that the Pharaoh buried her with much
      pomp in Ethiopia, sacrificing, I believe, many prisoners at her gorgeous
      funeral rites. From the wealth of that Pharaoh&mdash;for wealthy he must
      have been on account of his numerous victories&mdash;and from the love he
      bore this princess, I am confident&mdash;confident," added Braddock,
      striking the table vehemently, "that when discovered, her tomb will be
      filled with riches, and may also contain documents of incalculable value."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you wish to get the money?" asked Mrs. Jasher, who was rather bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor rose fiercely. "Money! I care nothing for money. I desire to
      obtain the funeral jewelry and golden masks, the precious images of the
      gods, so as to place them in the British Museum. And the scrolls of
      papyrus buried with the mummy of Tahoser may contain an account of
      Ethiopian civilization, about which we know nothing. Oh, that tomb,&mdash;that
      tomb!" Braddock began to walk the room, quite forgetting that he had not
      finished his dinner. "I know the mountains whose entrails were pierced to
      form the sepulchre. Were I able to go to Africa, I am certain that I
      should discover the tomb. Ah, with what glory would my name be covered,
      were I so fortunate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you go to Africa, sir, and try?" asked Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fool!" cried the Professor politely. "To fit out an expedition would take
      some five thousand pounds, if not more. I would have to penetrate through
      a hostile country to reach the chain of mountains I speak of, where I know
      this precious tomb is to be found. I need supplies, an escort, guns,
      camels, and all the rest of it. A leader must be obtained to manage the
      fighting men necessary to pass through this dangerous zone. It is no easy
      task to find the tomb of Tahoser. And yet if I could&mdash;if I could only
      get the money," and he walked up and down with his head bent on his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher was used to Braddock's vagaries by this time, and merely
      continued to fan herself placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could help you with the expedition," she said quietly. "I should
      like to have some of that lovely Egyptian jewelry myself. But I am quite a
      pauper, until my brother dies, poor man. Then&mdash;" She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?" asked Braddock, wheeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall aid you with pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a bargain!" Braddock stretched out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bargain," said Mrs. Jasher, accepting the grasp somewhat nervously, for
      she had not expected to be taken so readily at her word. A glance at Lucy
      revealed her nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do sit down, father, and finish your dinner," said that young lady. "I am
      sure you will have more than enough to do when the mummy arrives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mummy&mdash;what mummy?" murmured Braddock, again beginning to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Inca mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. The mummy of Inca Caxas, which Sidney is bringing from Malta.
      When I strip that corpse of its green bandages I shall find&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find what?" asked Archie, seeing that the Professor hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock cast a swift look at his questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall find the peculiar mode of Peruvian embalming," he replied
      abruptly, and somehow the way in which he spoke gave Hope the impression
      that the answer was an excuse. But before he could formulate the thought
      that Braddock was concealing something, Mrs. Jasher spoke frivolously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope your mummy has jewels," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has not," replied Braddock sharply. "So far as I know, the Inca race
      never buried their dead with jewels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have read in Prescott's History that they did," said Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prescott! Prescott!" cried the Professor contemptuously, "a most
      unreliable authority. However, I'll promise you one thing, Hope, that if
      there are any jewels, or jewelry, you shall have the lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me some, Mr. Hope," cried the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot," laughed Archie; "the green mummy belongs to the Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot accept such a gift, Hope. Owing to circumstances I have been
      obliged to borrow the money from you; otherwise the mummy would have been
      acquired by some one else. But when I find the tomb of Queen Tahoser, I
      shall repay the loan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have repaid it already," said Hope, looking at Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock's eyes followed his gaze and his brows contracted. "Humph!" he
      muttered, "I don't know if I am right in consenting to Lucy's marriage
      with a pauper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, father!" cried the girl, "Archie is not a pauper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have enough for Lucy and me to live on," said Hope, although his face
      had flushed, "and, had I been a pauper I could not have given you that
      thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be repaid&mdash;you will be repaid," said Braddock, waving his
      hand to dismiss the subject. "And now," he rose with a yawn, "if this
      tedious feast is at an end, I shall again seek my work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word of apology to the disgusted Mrs. Jasher, he trotted to the
      door, and there paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, Lucy," he said, turning, "I had a letter to-day from Random.
      He returns in his yacht to Pierside in two or three days. In fact, his
      arrival will coincide with that of The Diver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see what his arrival has to do with me," said Lucy tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing at all&mdash;nothing at all," said Braddock airily, "only I
      thought&mdash;that is, but never mind, never mind. Cockatoo, come down
      with me. Good night! Good night!" and he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mrs. Jasher, drawing along breath, "for rudeness and
      selfishness, commend me to a scientist. We might be all mud, for what
      notice he takes of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," said Miss Kendal, rising, "come to the drawing-room and have
      some music. Archie, will you stop here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I don't care to sit over my wine alone," said that young gentleman,
      rising. "I shall accompany you and Mrs. Jasher. And Lucy," he stopped her
      at the door, through which the widow had already passed, "what did your
      father mean by his hints concerning Random?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he regrets giving his consent to my marriage with you," she
      whispered back. "Did you not hear him talk about that tomb? He desires to
      get money for the expedition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Random? What rubbish! Sooner than that&mdash;if our marriage is
      stopped by the beastly business&mdash;I'll sell out and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll do nothing of the sort," interrupted the girl imperiously; "we
      must live if we marry. You have given my father enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if Random lends money for this expedition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does so at his own risk. I am not going to marry Sir Frank because of
      my step-father's requirements. He has no rights over me, and, whether he
      consents or not, I marry you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling!" and Archie kissed her before they followed Mrs. Jasher into
      the drawing-room. All the same, he foresaw trouble.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE UNEXPECTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the next two or three days, Archie felt decidedly, worried over his
      projected marriage with Lucy. Certainly he had&mdash;to put it bluntly&mdash;purchased
      Braddock's consent, and that gentleman could scarcely draw back from his
      plighted word, which had cost the lover so much. Nevertheless, Hope did
      not entirely, trust the Professor, as, from the few words which he had let
      drop at the dinner party, it was plain that he hankered after money with
      which to fit out the expedition in search of the mysterious tomb to which
      he had alluded. Archie knew, as did the Professor, that he could not
      supply the necessary five thousand pounds without practically ruining
      himself, and already he had crippled his resources in paying over the
      price of the green mummy. He had fondly believed that Braddock would have
      been satisfied with the relic of Peruvian humanity; but it seemed that the
      Professor, having got what he wanted, now clamored for what was at present
      beyond his reach. The mummy was his property, but he desired the contents
      of Queen Tahoser's tomb also. This particular moon, which he cried for,
      was a very expensive article, and Hope did not see how he could gain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless&mdash;and here came in the cause of Archie's worry&mdash;unless the
      five thousand pounds was borrowed from Sir Frank Random, the Professor
      would have to content himself with the Maltese mummy. But from what the
      young man had seen of Braddock's longing for the especial sepulchre, which
      he desired to loot, he believed that the scientist would not readily
      surrender his whim. Random could easily lend or give the money, since he
      was extremely rich, and extremely generous, but it was improbable that he
      would aid Braddock without a quid pro quo. As the sole desire of the
      baronet's heart was to make Lucy his wife, it could easily be guessed that
      he would only assist the Professor to realize his ambition on condition
      that the savant used his influence with his step-daughter. That meant the
      breaking of the engagement with Hope and the marriage of the girl to the
      soldier. Of course such a state of things would make Lucy unhappy; but
      Braddock cared very little for that. To gratify his craze for Egyptian
      research, he would be willing to sacrifice a dozen girls like Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly Lucy would refuse to be passed along from one man to another
      like a bale of goods, and Archie knew that, so far as in her lay, she
      would keep to her engagement, especially as she denied Braddock's right to
      dispose of her hand. All the same, the Professor, in spite of his
      cherubical looks, could make himself extremely disagreeable, and
      undoubtedly would do so if thwarted. The sole course that remained, should
      Braddock begin operations to break the present engagement, would be to
      marry Lucy at once. Archie would willingly have done so, but pecuniary
      difficulties stood in the way. He had never told any one of these, not
      even the girl he loved, but they existed all the same. For many years he
      had been assisting needy relatives, and thus had hampered himself, in
      spite of his income. By sheer force of will, so as to force Braddock into
      giving him Lucy, he had contrived to secure the necessary thousand pounds,
      without confusing the arrangements he had made to pay off certain debts
      connected with his domestic philanthropy; but this brought him to the end
      of his resources. In six months he hoped to be free to have his income
      entirely to himself, and then&mdash;small as it was&mdash;he could support
      a wife. But until the half year elapsed he could see no chance of marrying
      Lucy with any degree of comfort, and meanwhile she would be exposed to the
      persecutions of the Professor. Perhaps persecutions is too harsh a word,
      as Braddock was kind enough to the girl. Nevertheless, he was pertinacious
      in gaining his aims where his pet hobby was concerned, and undoubtedly,
      could he see any chance of obtaining the money from Random by selling his
      step-daughter, he would do so. Assuredly it was dishonorable to act in
      this way, but the Professor was a scientific Jesuit, and deemed that the
      end justified the means, when any glory to himself and gain to the British
      Museum was in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I may be doing him an injustice," said Archie, when he was explaining
      his fears to Miss Kendal on the third day after the dinner party. "After
      all, the Professor is a gentleman, and will probably hold to the bargain
      which he has made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care whether he does or not," cried Lucy, who had a fine color
      and a certain amount of fire in her eyes. "I am not going to be bought and
      sold to forward these nasty scientific schemes. My father can say what he
      likes and do what he likes, but I marry you&mdash;to-morrow if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it," said Archie, flushing, "we can't marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" she asked, much astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope looked at the ground and drew patterns with his cane-point in the
      sand. They were seated in the hot sunshine&mdash;for the Indian summer
      still continued&mdash;under a moldering brick wall, which ran around the
      most delightful of kitchen gardens. This was situated at the back of the
      Pyramids, and contained a multiplicity of pot herbs and fruit trees and
      vegetables. It resembled the Fairy Garden in Madame D'Alnoy's story of The
      White Cat, and in the autumn yielded a plentiful crop of fine-flavored
      fruit. But now the trees were bare and the garden looked somewhat forlorn
      for lack of greenery. But in spite of the lateness of the season, Lucy
      often brought a book to read under the glowing wall, and there ripened
      like a peach in the warm sunshine. On this occasion she brought Archie
      into the old-world garden, as he had hinted at confidences. And the time
      had come to speak plainly, as Hope began to think that he had not treated
      Lucy quite fairly in hiding from her his momentarily embarrassed position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why can't we marry at once?" asked Lucy, seeing that her lover held his
      peace and looked confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope did not reply directly. "I had better release you from your
      engagement," he said haltingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" Lucy's nostrils dilated and she threw back her head scornfully. "And
      the other woman's name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no other woman. I love you and you only. But&mdash;money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about money? You have your income!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes&mdash;that is sure, small as it is. But I have incurred debts on
      behalf of an uncle and his family. These have embarrassed me for the
      moment, and so I cannot see my way to marrying you for at least six
      months, Lucy." He caught her hand. "I feel ashamed of myself that I did
      not tell you of this before. But I feared to lose you. Yet, on reflection,
      I see that it is dishonorable to keep you in the dark, and if you think
      that I have behaved badly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I do in a way," she interrupted quickly, "as your silence was quite
      unnecessary. Don't treat me as a doll, my dear. I wish to share your
      troubles as well as your joys. Come, tell me all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not angry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am&mdash;at your thinking I loved you so little as to be biased
      against our marriage because of money troubles. Pooh!" she flicked away a
      speck of dust from his coat, "I don't care that for such things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an angel," he cried ardently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a very practical girl just now," she retorted. "Go on, confess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie, thus encouraged, did so, and it was a very mild confession that
      she heard, involving a great deal of unnecessary sacrifice in helping a
      pauper uncle. Hope strove to belittle his good deeds as much as possible,
      but Lucy saw plainly the good heart that had dictated the giving up of his
      small income for some years. When in possession of all the facts, she
      threw her arms around his neck and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a silly old boy," she whispered. "As if what you tell me could
      make any difference to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we can't be married for six months, dearest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. Do you believe that I as a woman can gather together my
      trousseau under six months? No, my dear. We must not marry in haste to
      repent at leisure. In another half year you will enjoy your own income,
      and then we can marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But meanwhile," said Archie, after kissing her, "the Professor will
      bother you to marry Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no. He has sold me to you for one thousand pounds. There! There, do
      not say a single word. I am only teasing you. Let us say that my father
      has consented to my marriage with you, and cannot withdraw his word. Not
      that I care if he does. I am my own mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucy!"&mdash;he took her hands again and looked into her eyes&mdash;"Braddock
      is a scientific lunatic, and would do anything to forward his aims with
      regard to this very expensive tomb, which he has set his heart on
      discovering. As I can't lend or give the money, he is sure to apply to
      Random, and Random&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will want to marry me," cried Lucy, rising. "No, my dear, not at all. Sir
      Frank is a gentleman, and when he learns that I am engaged to you, he will
      simply become a dear friend. There, don't worry any more about the matter.
      You ought to have told me of your troubles before, but as I have forgiven
      you, there is no more to be said. In six months I shall become Mrs. Hope,
      and meanwhile I can hold my own against any inconvenience that my father
      may cause me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;" He rose and began to remonstrate, anxious to abase himself
      still further before this angel of a maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed her hand over his mouth. "Not another word, or I shall box your
      ears, sir&mdash;that is, I shall exercise the privilege of a wife before I
      become one. And now," she slipped her arm within his, "let us go in and
      see the arrival of the precious mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it has arrived then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not here exactly. My father expects it at three o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is now a quarter to," said Archie, consulting his watch. "As I have
      been to London all yesterday I did not know that The Diver had arrived at
      Pierside, How is Bolton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy wrinkled her brows. "I am rather worried over Sidney," she said in an
      anxious voice, "and so is my father. He had not appeared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she looked at the ground in a pondering manner, "my father got a
      letter from Sidney yesterday afternoon, saying that the ship with the
      mummy and himself on board had arrived about four o'clock. The letter was
      sent on by special messenger and came at six."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it arrived in the evening and not in the afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How particular you are!" said Miss Kendal, with a shrug. "Well, then,
      Sidney said that he could not bring the mummy to this place last night as
      it was so late. He intended&mdash;so he told my father in the letter&mdash;to
      remove the case containing the mummy ashore to an inn near the wharf at
      Pierside, and there would remain the night so as to take care of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right," said Hope, puzzled. "Where's your difficulty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A note came from the landlord of the inn this morning, saying that by
      direction of Mr. Bolton&mdash;that is Sidney, you know&mdash;he was
      sending the mummy in its case to Gartley on a lorry, and that it would
      arrive at three o'clock this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" asked Hope, still puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she rejoined impatiently. "Can't you see show strange it is that
      Sidney should let the mummy out of his sight, after guarding it so
      carefully not only from Malta to England, but all the night in Pierside at
      that hotel? Why doesn't he bring the mummy here himself, and come on with
      the lorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no explanation&mdash;no letter from Sidney Bolton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None. He wrote yesterday, as I stated, saying that he would keep the case
      in the hotel, and send it on this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he use the word `send,' or the word `bring'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said 'send.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that shows he did not intend to bring it himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should he not do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay he will explain when he appears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry for him when he does appear," said Lucy seriously, "for
      my father is furious. Why, this precious mummy, for which so much has been
      paid, might have been lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! Who would steal a thing like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thing like that is worth nearly one thousand pounds," said Lucy in a
      dry tone, "and if anyone got wind of it, stealing would be easy, since
      Sidney, as appears likely, has sent on the case unguarded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us go in and see if Sidney arrives with the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed out of the garden and sauntered round to the front of the
      house. There, standing in the roadway, they beheld a ponderous lorry with
      a rough-looking driver standing at the horses' heads. The front door of
      the house was open, so the mummy case had apparently arrived before its
      time, and had been taken to Braddock's museum while they were chatting in
      the kitchen garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Mr. Bolton come with the case?" asked Lucy, leaning over the railings
      and addressing the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one came, miss, except myself and my two mates, who have taken the
      case indoor." The driver jerked a coarse thumb over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was Mr. Bolton at the hotel, where the case remained for the night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss&mdash;that is, I dunno who Mr. Bolton is. The landlord of the
      Sailor's Rest told me and my mates to take the case to this here house,
      and we done it. That's all I know, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange," murmured Lucy, walking to the front door. "What do you think,
      Archie? Isn't it strange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope nodded. "But I daresay Bolton will explain his absence," said he,
      following her. "He will arrive in time to open the mummy case along with
      the Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," said Miss Kendal, who looked much perplexed. "I can't
      understand Sidney abandoning the case, when it might so easily have been
      stolen. Come in and see my father, Archie," and she passed into the house,
      followed by the young man, whose curiosity was now aroused. As they
      entered the door, the two men who had taken in the case blundered out and
      shortly drove away on the lorry towards Jessum railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the museum they found Braddock purple with rage and swearing
      vigorously. He was staring at a large packing case, which had been set up
      on end against the wall, while beside him crouched Cockatoo, holding
      chisels and hammers and wedges necessary to open the treasure trove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the precious mummy has arrived, father," said Lucy, who saw that the
      Professor was furious. "Are you not pleased?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleased! pleased!" shouted the angry man of science. "How can I be
      pleased when I see how badly the case has been treated? See how it has
      been bruised and battered and shaken! I'll have an action against Captain
      Hervey of The Diver if my mummy has been injured. Sidney should have taken
      better care of so precious an object."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he say?" asked Archie, glancing round the museum to see if the
      delinquent had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" shouted Braddock again, and snatching a chisel from Cockatoo. "Oh,
      what can he say when he is not here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not here?" said Lucy, more and more surprised at the unaccountable
      absence of Braddock's assistant. "Where is he, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I wish I did; I'd have him arrested for neglecting to watch
      over this case. As it is, when he comes back I'll dismiss him from my
      employment. He can go back to his infernal laundry work along with his old
      witch of a mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why hasn't Bolton come back, sir?" asked Hope sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock struck a furious blow at the head of the chisel which he had
      inserted into the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know that. He brought the case to the Sailor's Rest, and should
      have come on with it this morning. Instead of doing so, he tells the
      landlord&mdash;a most unreliable man&mdash;to send it on. And my precious
      mummy&mdash;the mummy that has cost nine hundred pounds," cried Braddock,
      working furiously, and battering the chisel as though it were Bolton's
      head, "is left to be stolen by any scientific thief that comes along."
      While the Professor, assisted by Cockatoo, loosened the lid of the packing
      case, a mild voice was heard at the door. Lucy turned, as did Archie, to
      see Widow Anne curtseying on the threshold of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock himself took no notice of her entrance, being occupied with his
      task, and even while doing it swore scientifically under his breath. He
      was furious against Bolton for neglect of duty, and Hope rather
      sympathized with him. It was a serious matter to have left a valuable
      object like the green mummy to the rough care of laborers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, my lady," whimpered Widow Anne, who looked more lean
      and rusty and dismal than ever; "but has my Sid come? I saw the cart and
      the coffin. Where's my boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coffin! coffin!" bellowed Braddock angrily between thunder blows. "What
      do you mean by calling this case a coffin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it do hold one of them camphorated corps, sir," said Mrs. Bolton
      with another curtsey. "My boy Sid told me as much, afore he went to them
      furren parts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen him since he returned?" questioned Lucy, while Braddock and
      Cockatoo strained at the lid, now nearly off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I ain't set eyes on him," moaned the widow dismally, "and summat
      tells me as I never will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk rubbish, woman," said Archie tartly, for he did not wish Lucy
      to be upset again by this ancient ghoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman indeed, sir. I'd have you know,&mdash;oh!" the widow jumped and
      quavered as the lid of the packing case fell on the floor with a bang. "Oh
      lor, sir, the start you did give me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Braddock had no eyes for her, and no ears for anyone. He pulled
      lustily at the straw packing, and soon the floor was littered with
      rubbish. But no green case appeared, and no mummy. Suddenly Widow Anne
      shrieked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's my Sid&mdash;dead&mdash;oh, my son, dead! dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke truly. The body of Sidney Bolton was before them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. MYSTERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      After that one cry of agony from Widow Anne, there was silence for quite
      one minute. The terrible contents of the packing case startled and
      terrified all present. Faint and white, Lucy clung to the arm of her lover
      to keep herself from sinking to the ground, as Mrs. Bolton had done.
      Archie stared at the grotesque rigidity of the body, as though he had been
      changed into stone, while Professor Braddock stared likewise, scarcely
      able to credit the evidence of his eyes. Only the Kanaka was unmoved and
      squatted on his hams, indifferently surveying the living and the dead. As
      a savage he could not be expected to have the nerves of civilized man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock, who had dropped chisel and hammer in the first movement of
      surprise, was the quickest to recover his powers of speech. The sole
      question he asked, revealed the marvelous egotism of a scientist,
      nominated by one idea. "Where is the mummy of Inca Caxas?" he murmured
      with a bewildered air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow Anne, groveling on the floor, pulled her gray locks into wild
      confusion, and uttered a cry of mingled rage and grief. "He asks that? he
      asks that?" she cried, stammering and choking, "when he has murdered my
      poor boy Sid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" demanded Braddock sharply, and recovering from a veritable
      stupor, which the disappearance of the mummy and the sight of his dead
      assistant had thrown him into. "Kill your son: how could I kill your son?
      What advantage would it have been to me had I killed your son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows! God knows!" sobbed the old woman, "but you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Bolton, you are raving," said Hope hastily, and strove to raise her
      from the floor. "Let Miss Kendal take you away. And you go, Lucy: this
      sight is too terrible for your eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, inarticulate with nervous fear, nodded and tottered towards the door
      of the museum; but Widow Anne refused to be lifted to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy is dead," she wailed; "my boy Sid is a corp as I saw him in my
      dream. In the coffin, too, cut to pieces&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rubbish! rubbish!" interrupted Braddock, peering into the depths of the
      packing case. "I can see no wound."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bolton leaped to her feet with an agility surprising in so aged a
      woman. "Let me find the wound," she screamed, throwing herself forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope caught her back and forced her towards the door. "No! The body must
      not be disturbed until the police see it," he said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The police&mdash;ah, yes, the police," remarked Braddock quickly, "we
      must send for the police to Pierside and tell them my mummy has been
      stolen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That my boy has been murdered," screeched Widow Anne, waving her skinny
      arms, and striving to break from Archie. "You wicked old devil to kill my
      darling Sid. If he hadn't gone to them furren parts he wouldn't be a corp
      now. But I'll have the lawr: you'll be hanged, you&mdash;you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock lost his patience under this torrent of unjust accusations and
      rushed towards Mrs. Bolton, dragging Cockatoo by the arm. In less time
      than it takes to tell, he had swept both Archie and the widow out into the
      hall, where Lucy was trembling, and Cockatoo, by his master's order, was
      locking the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a thing shall be touched until the police come. Hope, you are, a
      witness that I have not meddled with the dead: you were present when I
      opened the packing case: you have seen that a useless body has been
      substituted for a valuable mummy. And yet this old witch dares&mdash;dares&mdash;"
      Braddock stamped and grew incoherent from sheer rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie soothed him, leaving go of Widow Anne's arm to do so. "Hush! hush!"
      said the young man quietly, "the poor woman does not know what she is
      saying. I'll go for the police and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," interrupted the Professor sharply; "Cockatoo can go for the
      inspector of Pierside. I shall call in the village constable. Meanwhile
      you keep the key of the museum," he dropped it into Hope's breast-pocket,
      "so that you and the police may be sure the body has not been touched.
      Widow Anne, go home," he turned angrily on the old creature, who was now
      trembling after her burst of rage, "and don't dare to come here again
      until you ask pardon for what you have said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to be near my poor boy's corp," wailed Widow Anne, "and I'm very
      sorry, Perfesser. I didn't mean to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have, you witch. Go away!" and he stamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by this time Lucy had recovered her self-possession, which had been
      sorely shaken by the sight of the dead. "Leave her to me," she observed,
      taking Mrs. Bolton's arm, and leading her towards the stairs. "I shall
      take her to my room and give her some brandy. Father, you must make some
      allowance for her natural grief, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock stamped again. "Take her away! take her away!" he cried testily,
      "and keep her out of my sight. Is it not enough to have lost an invaluable
      assistant, and a costly mummy of infinite historical and archaeological
      value, without my being accused of&mdash;of&mdash;oh!" The Professor
      choked with rage and shook his hand in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he was unable to speak, Lucy seized the opportunity of the
      lull in the storm, and hurried the old woman, sobbing and moaning, up the
      stairs. By this time the shrieks of Mrs. Bolton, and the wordy wrath of
      Braddock, had drawn the cook and her husband, along with the housemaid,
      from the basement to the ground floor. The sight of their surprised faces
      only added to their master's anger, and he advanced furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go downstairs again: go down, I tell you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if there's anything wrong, sir," ventured the gardener timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything is wrong. My mummy has been lost: Mr. Bolton has been
      murdered. The police are coming, and&mdash;and&mdash;" He choked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the servants waited to hear no more. The mere mention of the words
      "murder" and "police" sent them, pale-faced and startled, down to the
      basement, where they huddled like a flock of sheep. Braddock looked around
      for Hope, but found that he had opened the front door, and had vanished.
      But he was too distracted to think why Archie had gone, and there was much
      to do in putting things straight. Beckoning to Cockatoo, he stalked into a
      side room, and scribbled a pencil note to the inspector of police at
      Pierside, telling him of what had happened, and asking him to come at once
      to the Pyramids with his underlings. This communication he dispatched by
      Cockatoo, who flew to get his bicycle. In a short time he was riding at
      top speed to Brefort, which was on this side of the river; facing
      Pierside. There he could ferry across to the town and deliver his terrible
      message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done all that he could until the police came, Braddock walked out
      of the front door and into the roadway to see if Archie was in sight. He
      could not see the young man, but, as luck would have it, and by one of
      those coincidences which are much more common than is suspected, he saw
      the Gartley doctor walking briskly past.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi!" shouted the Professor, who was purple in the face and perspiring
      profusely. "Hi, there, Dr. Robinson! I want you. Come! come! hurry, man,
      hurry!" he ended in a testy rage, and the doctor, knowing Braddock's
      eccentricities, advanced with a smile. He was a slim, dark, young medical
      practitioner with an amiable countenance, which argued of no mighty
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Professor," he remarked quietly, "do you want me to attend you for
      apoplexy? Take your time, my dear sir&mdash;take your time." He patted the
      scientist on the shoulder to soothe his clamorous rage. "You are already
      purple in the face. Don't let your blood rush to your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Robinson, you're a&mdash;a&mdash;a fool!" shouted Braddock, glaring at
      the suave looks of the doctor. "I am in perfect health, damn you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Miss Kendal&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is quite well also. But Bolton&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" Robinson looked interested. "Has he returned with your mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mummy," bellowed Braddock, stamping like an insane Cupid&mdash;"the mummy
      hasn't arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Professor, you surprise me," said the doctor mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll surprise you more," growled Braddock, dragging Robinson into the
      garden and up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently! gently! my dear sir," said the doctor, who really began to think
      that much learning had made the Professor mad. "Didn't Bolton&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bolton is dead, you fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!" The doctor nearly tumbled backward down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murdered. At least I think he is murdered. At all events he arrived here
      to-day in the packing case, which should have contained my green mummy.
      Come in and examine the body at once. No," Braddock pushed back the doctor
      just as fiercely as he had dragged him forward, "wait until the constable
      comes. I want him to see the body first, and to observe that nothing has
      been touched. I have sent for the Pierside inspector to come. There will
      be all sorts of trouble," cried Braddock despairingly, "and my work&mdash;most
      important work&mdash;will be delayed, just because this silly young ass
      Sidney Bolton chose to be murdered," and the Professor stormed up and down
      the hall, shaking impotent arms in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" stammered Robinson, who was young in years and somewhat
      new to his profession, "you&mdash;you must be mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mistaken! mistaken!" shouted Braddock with another glare. "Come and see
      that poor fellow's body then. He is dead, murdered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang you, sir, how should I know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way has he been murdered? Stabbed, shot, or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;I don't know! Such a nuisance to lose a man like
      Bolton&mdash;an invaluable assistant. What I shall do without him I really
      don't know. And his mother has been here, making no end of a fuss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you blame her?" said the doctor, recovering his breath. "She is his
      mother, after all, and poor Bolton was her only son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not denying the relationship, confound you!" snapped the Professor,
      ruffling his hair until it stood up like the crest of a parrot. "But she
      needn't&mdash;ah!" He glanced through the open door, and then rushed to
      the threshold. "Here is Hope and Painter. Come in&mdash;come in. I have
      the doctor here. Hope, you have the key. You observe, constable, that Mr.
      Hope has the key. Open the door: open the door, and let us see the meaning
      of this dreadful crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crime, sir?" queried the constable, who had heard all that was known from
      Hope, but now wished to hear what Braddock had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, crime: crime, you idiot! I have lost my mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought, sir, that a murder&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course&mdash;of course," gabbled the Professor, as if the death
      was quite a minor consideration. "Bolton's dead&mdash;murdered, I suppose,
      as he could scarcely have nailed himself down in a packing case. But it's
      my precious mummy I am thinking of, Painter. A mummy&mdash;if you know
      what a mummy is&mdash;that cost me nine hundred pounds. Go in, man. Go in
      and don't stand there gaping. Don't you see that Mr. Hope has opened the
      door. I have sent Cockatoo to Pierside to notify the police. They will
      soon be here. Meanwhile, doctor, you can examine the body, and Painter
      here can give his opinion as to who stole my mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The assassin stole the mummy," said Archie, as the four men entered the
      museum, "and substituted the body of the murdered man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all A B C," snapped Braddock, issuing into the vast room, "but we
      want to know the name of the assassin, if we are to revenge Bolton and get
      back my mummy. Oh, what a loss!&mdash;what a loss! I have lost nine
      hundred pounds, or say one thousand, considering the cost of bringing Inca
      Caxas to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie forebore to remind the Professor as to who had really lost the
      money, as the scientist was not in a fit state to be talked to reasonably,
      and seemed much more concerned because his Peruvian relic of humanity had
      been lost than for the terrible death of Sidney Bolton. But by this time
      Painter&mdash;a fair-haired young constable of small intelligence&mdash;was
      examining the packing case and surveying the dead. Dr. Robinson also
      looked with a professional eye, and Braddock, wiping his purple face and
      gasping with exhaustion, sat down on a stone sarcophagus. Archie, folding
      his arms, leaned against the wall and waited quietly to hear what the
      experts in crime and medicine would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The packing case was deep and wide and long, made of tough teak and banded
      at intervals with iron bands. Within this was a case of tin, which, when
      it held the mummy, had been soldered up; impervious to air and water. But
      the unknown person who had extracted the mummy, to replace it by a
      murdered man's body, had cut open the tin casing with some sharp
      instrument. There was straw round the tin casing and straw within, amongst
      which the body of the unfortunate young man was placed. Rigor mortis had
      set in, and the corpse, with straight legs and hands placed stiffly by its
      side, lay against the back of the tin casing surrounded more or less by
      the straw packing, or at least by so much as the Professor had not torn
      away. The face looked dark, and the eyes were wide open and staring.
      Robinson stepped forward and ran his hand round the neck. Uttering an
      ejaculation, he removed the woollen scarf which the dead man had probably
      worn to keep himself from catching cold, and those who looked on saw that
      a red-colored window cord was tightly bound about the throat of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor devil has been strangled," said the doctor quietly. "See: the
      assassin has left the bow-string on, and had the courage to place over it
      this scarf, which belonged to Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that, sir?" asked Painter heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because Widow Anne knitted that scarf for Bolton before he went to Malta.
      He showed it to me, laughingly, remarking that his mother evidently
      thought that he was going to Lapland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did he show it to you, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before he went to Malta, of course," said Robinson in mild surprise. "You
      don't suppose he showed it to me when he returned. When did he return to
      England?" he asked the Professor, with an afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday afternoon, about four o'clock," replied Braddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, from the condition of the body"&mdash;the doctor felt the dead
      flesh&mdash;"he must have been murdered last night. H'm! With your
      permission, Painter, I'll examine the corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable shook his head. "Better wait, sir, until the inspector
      comes," he said in his unintelligent way. "Poor Sid! Why, I knew him. He
      was at school with me, and now he's dead. Who killed him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      None of his listeners could answer this question.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE INQUEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Like a geographical Lord Byron, the isolated village of Gartley awoke one
      morning to find itself famous. Previously unknown, save to the inhabitants
      of Brefort, Jessum, and the surrounding country, and to the soldiers
      stationed in the Fort, it became a nine days' centre of interest.
      Inspector Date of Pierside arrived with his constables to inquire into the
      reported crime, and the local journalists, scenting sensation, came flying
      to Gartley on bicycles and in traps. Next morning London was duly advised
      that a valuable mummy was missing, and that the assistant of Professor
      Braddock, who had been sent to fetch it from Malta, was murdered by
      strangulation. In a couple of days the three kingdoms were ringing with
      the news of the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a mystery it proved, to be, for, in spite of Inspector Date's efforts
      and the enterprise of Scotland Yard detectives summoned by the Professor,
      no clue could be found to the identity of the assassin. Briefly, the story
      told by the newspapers ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp steamer Diver&mdash;Captain George Hervey in command&mdash;had
      berthed alongside the Pierside jetty at four o'clock on a Wednesday
      afternoon in mid-September, and some two hours later Sidney Bolton removed
      the case, containing the green mummy, ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was impossible to carry the case to the Pyramids on that night,
      Bolton had placed it in his bedroom at the Sailor's Rest, a mean little
      public-house of no very savory reputation near the water's edge. He was
      last seen alive by the landlord and the barmaid, when, after a drink of
      harmless ginger-beer, he retired to bed at eight, leaving instructions to
      the landlord&mdash;overheard by the barmaid&mdash;that the case was to be
      sent on next day to Professor Braddock of Gartley. Bolton hinted that he
      might leave the hotel early and would probably precede the case to its
      destination, so as to advise Professor Braddock&mdash;necessarily anxious&mdash;of
      its safe arrival. Before retiring he paid his bill, and deposited in the
      landlord's hand a small sum of money, so that the case might be sent
      across stream to Brefort, thence to be taken in a lorry to the Pyramids.
      There was no sign, said the barmaid and the landlord, that Bolton
      contemplated suicide, or that he feared sudden death. His whole demeanor
      was cheerful, and he expressed himself exceedingly glad to be in England
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven on the ensuing morning, a persistent knocking and a subsequent
      opening of the door of Bolton's bedroom proved that he was not in the
      room, although the tumbled condition of the bed-clothes proved that he had
      taken some rest. No one in the hotel thought anything of Bolton's absence,
      since he had hinted at an early departure, although the chamber-maid
      considered it strange that no one had seen him leave the hotel. The
      landlord obeyed Bolton's instructions and sent the case, in charge of a
      trustworthy man, to Brefort across the river. There a lorry was procured,
      and the case was taken to Gartley, where it arrived at three in the
      afternoon. It was then that Professor Braddock, in opening the case,
      discovered the body of his ill-fated assistant, rigid in death, and with a
      red window cord tightly bound round the throat of the corpse. At once,
      said the newspapers, the Professor sent for the police, and later insisted
      that the smartest Scotland Yard detectives should come down to elucidate
      the mystery. At present both police and detectives were engaged in
      searching for a needle in a haystack, and so far had met with no success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the tale set forth in the local and London and provincial
      journals. Widely as it was discussed, and many as were the theories
      offered, no one could fathom the mystery. But all agreed that the failure
      of the police to find a clue was inexplicable. It was difficult enough to
      understand how the assassin could have murdered Bolton and opened the
      packing case, and removed the mummy to replace it by the body of his
      victim in a house filled with at least half a dozen people; but it was yet
      more difficult to guess how the criminal had escaped with so noticeable an
      object as the mummy, bandaged with emerald-hued woollen stuff woven from
      the hair of Peruvian llamas. If the culprit was one who thieved and
      murdered for gain, he could scarcely sell the mummy without being
      arrested, since all England was ringing with the news of its
      disappearance; if a scientist, impelled to robbery by an archaeological
      mania, he could not possibly keep possession of the mummy without someone
      learning that he possessed it. Meanwhile the thief and his plunder had
      vanished as completely as if the earth had swallowed both. Great was the
      wonder at the cleverness of the criminal, and many were the solutions
      offered to account for the disappearance. One enterprising weekly paper,
      improving on the Limerick craze, offered a furnished house and three
      pounds a week for life to the fortunate person who could solve the
      mystery. As yet no one had won the prize, but it was early days yet, and
      at least five thousand amateur detectives tried to work out the problem.

      Naturally Hope was sorry for the untimely death of Bolton, whom he had
      known as an amiable and clever young man. But he was also annoyed that his
      loan of the money to Braddock should have been, so to speak, nullified by
      the loss of the mummy. The Professor was perfectly furious at his double
      loss of assistant and embalmed corpse, and was only prevented from
      offering a reward for the discovery of the thief and assassin by the
      painful fact that he had no money. He hinted to Archie that a reward
      should be offered, but that young man, backed by Lucy, declined to throw
      away good money after bad. Braddock took this refusal so ill, that Hope
      felt perfectly convinced he would try and wriggle out of his promise to
      permit the marriage and persuade Lucy to engage herself to Sir Frank
      Random, should the baronet be willing to offer a reward. And Hope was also
      certain that Braddock, a singularly obstinate man, would never rest until
      he once more had the mummy in his possession. That the murderer of Sidney
      Bolton should be hanged was quite a minor consideration with the
      Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Widow Anne had insisted on the dead body being taken to her
      cottage, and Braddock, with the consent of Inspector Date, willingly
      agreed, as he did not wish a newly dead corpse to remain under his roof.
      Therefore, the remains of the unfortunate young man were taken to his
      humble home, and here the body was inspected by the jury when the inquest
      took place in the coffee-room of the Warrior Inn, immediately opposite
      Mrs. Bolton's abode. There was a large crowd round the inn, as people had
      come from far and wide to hear the verdict of the jury, and Gartley, for
      the first and only time in its existence, presented the aspect of an
      August Bank Holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner&mdash;an elderly doctor with a short temper; caused by the
      unrealized ambition of a country practitioner&mdash;opened the proceedings
      by a snappy speech, in which he set forth the details of the crime in the
      same bold fashion in which they had been published by the newspapers. A
      plan of the Sailor's Rest was then placed before the jury, and the Coroner
      drew the attention of the twelve good and lawful men to the fact that the
      bedroom occupied by deceased was on the ground floor, with a window
      looking out on to the river, merely a stone-throw away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you will see, gentlemen," said the Coroner, "that the difficulty of
      the assassin in leaving the hotel with his plunder was not so great as has
      been imagined. He had merely to open the window in the quiet hours of the
      night, when no one was about, and pass the mummy through to his
      accomplice, who probably waited without. It is also probable that a boat
      was waiting by the bank of the river, and the mummy having been placed in
      this, the assassin and his friend could row away into the unknown without
      the slightest chance of discovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspector Date&mdash;a tall, thin, upright man with an iron jaw and a
      severe expression&mdash;drew the Coroner's attention to the fact that
      there was no evidence to show that the assassin had an accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you have stated, sir, may have occurred," rasped Date in a military
      voice, "but we cannot prove the truth of your assumption, since the
      evidence at our disposal is merely circumstantial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never suggested that it was anything else," snapped the Coroner. "You
      waste time in traversing my statements. Say what you have to say, Mr.
      Inspector, and produce your witnesses&mdash;if you have any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are no witnesses who can swear to the identity of the murderer,"
      said Inspector Date coldly, and determined not to be ruffled by the
      apparent antagonism of the Coroner. "The criminal has vanished, and no one
      can guess his name or occupation, or even the reason which led him to slay
      the deceased."
    </p>
    <p>
      Coroner: "The reason is plain. He wanted the mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspector: "Why should he want the mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Coroner: "That is what we wish to find out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspector: "Exactly, sir. We wish to learn the reason why the murderer
      strangled the deceased."
    </p>
    <p>
      Coroner: "We know that reason. What we wish to know is why the murderer
      stole the mummy. And I would point out to you, Mr. Inspector, that, as
      yet, we do not even know the sex of the assassin. It might be a woman who
      murdered the deceased."
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Braddock, who was seated near the door of the coffee-room, being
      even more irascible than usual, rose to contradict.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There isn't a scrap of evidence to show that the murderer was a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Coroner: "You are out of order, sir. And I would point out that, as yet,
      Inspector Date has produced no witnesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Date glared. He and the Coroner were old enemies, and always sparred when
      they met. It seemed likely, that the peppery little Professor would join
      in the quarrel and that there would be a duel of three; but Date, not
      wishing for an adverse report in the newspapers as to his conduct of the
      case, contented himself with the glare aforesaid, and, after a short
      speech, called Braddock. The Professor, looking more like a cross cherub
      than ever, gave his evidence tartly. It seemed ridiculous to his
      prejudiced mind that all this fuss should be made over Bolton's body, when
      the mummy; was still missing. However, as the discovery of the criminal
      would assuredly lead to the regaining of that precious Peruvian relic, he
      curbed his wrath and answered the Coroner's questions in a fairly amiable
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after all, Braddock had very little to tell. He had, so he stated,
      seen an advertisement in a newspaper that a mummy, swathed in green
      bandages, was to be sold in Malta; and had sent his assistant to buy it
      and bring it home. This was done, and what happened after the mummy left
      the tramp steamer was known to everyone, through the medium of the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With which," grumbled the Professor, "I do not agree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?" asked the Coroner sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, sir," snapped Braddock, equally sharply, "that the publicity
      given by the newspapers to these details will probably place the assassin
      on his guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not on her guard?" persisted the Coroner wilfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rubbish! rubbish! rubbish! My mummy wasn't stolen by a woman. What the
      devil would a woman want with my mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be more respectful, Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then talk sense, doctor," and the two glared at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment or two the situation was adjusted in silence, and the
      Coroner asked a few questions, pertinent to the matter in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had the deceased any enemies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, he hadn't, not being famous enough, or rich enough, or clever
      enough to excite the hatred of mankind. He was simply an intelligent young
      man, who worked excellently when supervised by me. His mother is a
      washerwoman in this village, and the lad brought washing to my house.
      Noting that he was intelligent and was anxious to rise above his station,
      I engaged him as my assistant and trained him to do my work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Archaeological work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I don't wash, whatever Bolton's mother may, do. Don't ask silly
      questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be more respectful," said the Coroner again, and grew red. "Have you any
      idea as to the name of anyone who desired to obtain possession of this
      mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay dozens of scientists in my line of business would have liked to
      get the corpse of Inca Caxas. Such as&mdash;" and he reeled out a list of
      celebrated men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," growled the Coroner. "Famous men like those you mention would
      not murder even for the sake of obtaining this mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said that they would," retorted Braddock, "but you wanted to hear
      who would like to have the mummy; and I have told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner waived the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was there any jewelry on the mummy likely to attract a thief?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How the devil should I know?" fumed the Professor. "I never unpacked the
      mummy; I never even saw it. Any jewelry buried with Inca Caxas would be
      bound up in the bandages. So far as I know those bandages were never
      unwound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can throw no light on the subject?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't. Bolton went to get the mummy and brought it home. I
      understood that he would personally bring his precious charge to my house;
      but he didn't. Why, I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Professor stepped down, still fuming at what he considered were
      the unnecessary questions of the Coroner, the young doctor who had
      examined the corpse was called. Robinson deposed that deceased had been
      strangled by means of a red window cord, and that, from the condition of
      the body, he would judge death had taken place some twelve hours more or
      less before the opening of the packing case by Braddock. That was at three
      o'clock on Thursday afternoon, so in witness's opinion the crime was
      committed between two and three on the previous morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't be absolutely certain as to the precise hour," added witness;
      "at any rate poor Bolton was strangled after midnight and before three
      o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a wide margin," grumbled the Coroner, jealous of his
      brother-practitioner. "Were there any, other wounds on the body?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. You can see for yourself, if you have inspected the corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner, thus reproved, glared, and Widow Anne appeared after Robinson
      retired. She stated, with many sobs, that her son had no enemies and was a
      good, kind young man. She also related her dream, but this was flouted by
      the Coroner, who did not believe in the occult. However, the narration of
      her premonition was listened to with deep interest by those in the court.
      Widow Anne concluded her evidence by asking how she was to live now that
      her boy Sid was dead. The Coroner professed himself unable to answer this
      question, and dismissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel Quass, the landlord of the Sailor's Rest, was next called. He
      proved to be a big, burly, red-haired, red-whiskered man, who looked like
      a sailor. And indeed a few questions elicited the information that he was
      a retired sea-captain. He gave his evidence gruffly but honestly, and
      although he kept so shady a public-house, seemed straightforward enough.
      He told much the same tale as had appeared in the newspapers. In the hotel
      on that night there was only himself, his wife and two children, and the
      staff of servants. Bolton retired to bed saying that he might start early
      for Gartley, and paid one pound to get the case taken across to river and
      placed on a lorry. As Bolton had vanished next morning, Quass obeyed
      instructions, with the result which everyone knew. He also stated that he
      did not know the case contained a mummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you think it contained?" asked the Coroner quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clothes and curios from foreign parts," said the witness coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Mr. Bolton tell you so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told me nothing about the case," growled the witness, "but he chatted
      a lot about Malta, which I know well, having put into that port frequent
      when a sailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he hint at any rows taking place at Malta?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he say that he had enemies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he strike you as a man who was in fear of death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he didn't," said the witness for the third time. "He seemed happy
      enough. I never thought for one moment that he was dead until I heard how
      his body had been found in the packing case."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner asked all manner of questions, and so did Inspector Date; but
      all attempts to incriminate Quass were vain. He was bluff and
      straightforward, and told&mdash;so far as could be judged&mdash;everything
      he knew. There was nothing for it but to dismiss him, and Eliza Flight was
      called as the last witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She also proved to be the most important, as she knew several things which
      she had not told to her master, or to the reporters, or even to the
      police. On being asked why she had kept silence, she said that her desire
      was to obtain any reward that might be offered; but as she had heard that
      there would be no reward, she was willing to tell what she knew. It was an
      important piece of evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stated that Bolton had retired to bed at eight on the ground
      floor, and the bedroom had a window&mdash;as marked in the plan&mdash;which
      looked on to the river a stone-throw distant. At nine or a trifle later
      witness went out to have a few words with her lover. In the darkness she
      saw that the window was open and that Bolton was talking to an old woman
      muffled in a shawl. She could not see the woman's face, nor judge of her
      stature, as she was stooping down to listen to Bolton. Witness did not
      take much notice, as she was in a hurry to see her lover. When she
      returned past the window at ten o'clock it was closed and the light was
      extinguished, so she thought that Mr. Bolton was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, to tell the truth," said Eliza Flight, "I never thought anything of
      the matter at all. It was only after the murder that I saw how important
      it was I should remember everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said the girl, honestly enough. "I have told you everything
      that happened on that night. Next morning&mdash;" She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what about next morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Bolton had locked his door. I know that, because a few minutes after
      eight on the night before, not knowing he had retired. I tried to enter
      the room and make ready the bed for the night. He sang out through the
      door&mdash;which was locked, for I tried it&mdash;that he was in bed. That
      was a lie also, as after nine I saw him talking to the woman at the
      window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You previously said an old woman," said the Coroner, referring to his
      notes. "How do you know she was old?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say if she was old or young," said the witness candidly; "it's
      only a manner of speaking. She had a dark shawl over her head and a dark
      dress. I couldn't say if she was old or young, fair or dark, stout or
      lean, tall or short. The night was dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner referred to the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a gas-lamp near the window of the bedroom. Did you not see her
      in that light?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, sir; but just for a moment. I took very little notice. Had I
      known that the gentleman was to be murdered, I should have taken a great
      deal of notice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, about this locked door?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was locked over-night, sir, but when I went next morning, it was not
      locked. I knocked and knocked, but could get no answer. As it was eleven,
      I thought the gentleman was sleeping very long, so I tried to open the
      door. It was not locked, as I say&mdash;but," added witness with emphasis,
      "the window was snibbed and the blind was down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is natural enough," said the Coroner. "Mr. Bolton, after his
      interview with the woman, would of course snib the window, and pull down
      the blind. When he went away next morning he would unlock the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begging your pardon, sir, but, as we know, he didn't go away next
      morning, being in the packing case, nailed down."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner could have kicked himself for the very natural mistake he had
      made, for he saw a derisive grin on the faces around him, and particularly
      on that of Inspector Date.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the assassin must have gone out by the door," he said weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I don't know how he got out," cried Eliza Flight, "for I was up at
      six and the front and back doors of the hotel were locked. And after six I
      was about in passages and rooms doing my work, and master and missus and
      others were all over the place. How could the murderer walk out, sir,
      without some of us seeing him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you did, and took no notice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, if a stranger was around we should all have taken notice."
    </p>
    <p>
      This concluded the evidence, which was meagre enough. Widow Anne was
      indeed recalled to see if Miss Flight could identify her as the woman who,
      had been talking to Bolton, but witness failed to recognize her, and the
      widow herself proved, by means of three friends, that she had been
      imbibing gin at home on the night and at the hour in question. Also, there
      was no evidence to connect this unknown woman with the murder, and no
      sound&mdash;according to the unanimous testimony of the inmates of the
      Sailor's Rest&mdash;had been heard in the bedroom of Bolton. Yet, as the
      Coroner observed, there must have been some knocking and hammering and
      ripping going on. But of this nothing could be proved, and although
      several witnesses were examined again, not one could throw light on the
      mystery. Under these circumstances the jury could only bring in a verdict
      of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown, which was done.
      And it may be mentioned that the cord with which Bolton had been strangled
      was identified by the landlord and the chamber-maid as belonging to the
      blind of the bedroom window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Hope, when the inquest was over, "so nothing can be proved
      against anyone. What is to be done next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you after I have seen Random," said the Professor curtly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE CAPTAIN OF THE DIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after the inquest, Sidney Bolton's body was buried in Gartley
      churchyard. Owing to the nature of the death, and the publicity given to
      the murder by the press, a great concourse of people assembled to witness
      the interment, and there was an impressive silence when the corpse was
      committed to the grave. Afterwards, as was natural, much discussion
      followed on the verdict at the inquest. It was the common opinion that the
      jury could have brought in no other verdict, considering the nature of the
      evidence supplied; but many people declared that Captain Hervey of The
      Diver should have been called. If the deceased had enemies, said these
      wiseacres, it was probable that he would have talked about them to the
      skipper. But they forgot that the witnesses called at the inquest,
      including the mother of the dead man, had insisted that Bolton had no
      enemies, so it is difficult to see what they expected Captain Hervey to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the funeral, the journals made but few remarks about the mystery.
      Every now and then it was hinted that a clue had been found, and that the
      police would sooner or later track down the criminal. But all this loose
      chatter came to nothing, and as the days went by, the public&mdash;in
      London, at all events&mdash;lost interest in the case. The enterprising
      weekly paper that had offered the furnished house and the life income to
      the person who found the assassin received an intimation from the
      Government that such a lottery could not be allowed. The paper, therefore,
      returned to Limericks, and the amateur detectives, like so many Othellos,
      found their occupation gone. Then a political crisis took place in the far
      East, and the fickle public relegated the murder of Bolton to the list of
      undiscovered crimes. Even the Scotland Yard detectives, failing to find a
      clue, lost interest in the matter, and it seemed as though the mystery of
      Bolton's death would not be solved until the Day of Judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the village, however, people still continued to be keenly interested,
      since Bolton was one of themselves, and, moreover, Widow Anne kept up a
      perpetual outcry about her murdered boy. She had lost the small weekly sum
      which Sidney had allowed her out of his wages, so the neighbors, the
      gentry of the surrounding country, and the officers at the Fort sent her
      ample washing to do. Widow Anne in a few weeks had quite a large business,
      considering the size of the village, and philosophically observed to a
      neighbor that "It was an ill wind which blew no one any good," adding also
      that Sidney was more good to her dead than alive. But even in Gartley the
      villagers grew weary of discussing a mystery which could never be solved,
      and so the case became rarely talked about. In these days of bustle and
      worry and competition, it is wonderful how people forget even important
      events. If a blue sun arose to lighten the world instead of a yellow one,
      after nine days of wonder, man would settle down quite comfortably to a
      cerulean existence. Such is the wonderful adaptability of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Braddock was less forgetful, as he always bore in mind the loss
      of his mummy, and constantly thought of schemes whereby he could trap the
      assassin of his late secretary. Not that he cared for the dead in any way,
      save from a strictly business point of view, but the capture of the
      criminal meant the restitution of the mummy, and&mdash;as Braddock told
      everyone with whom he came in contact&mdash;he was determined to regain
      possession of his treasure. He went himself to the Sailor's Rest, and
      drove the landlord and his servants wild by asking tart questions and
      storming when a satisfactory answer could not be supplied. Quass was glad
      when he saw the plump back of the cross little man, who so pertinaciously
      followed what everyone else had abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life was too short," grumbled Quass, "to be bothered in that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wooing of Archie and Lucy went on smoothly, and the Professor showed
      no sign of wishing to break the engagement. But Hope, as he confided to
      Lucy, was somewhat worried, as his pauper uncle, on an insufficient
      borrowed capital, had begun to speculate in South African mines, and it
      was probable that he would lose all his money. In that case Hope fancied
      he would be once more called upon to make good the avuncular loss, and so
      the marriage would have to be postponed. But it so happened that the
      pauper uncle made some lucky speculative shots and acquired money, which
      he promptly reinvested in new mines of the wildcat description. Still, for
      the moment all was well, and the lovers had a few halcyon days of peace
      and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a bolt from the blue in the person of Captain Hervey, who called
      a fortnight after the funeral to see the Professor. The skipper was a
      tall, slim man, lean as a fasting friar, and hard as nails, with closely
      clipped red hair, mustache of the same aggressive hue, and an American
      goatee. He spoke with a Yankee accent, and in a truculent manner,
      sufficiently annoying to the fiery Professor. When he met Braddock in the
      museum, the two became enemies at the first glance, and because both were
      bad-tempered and obstinate, took an instant dislike to one another. Like
      did not draw to like in this instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want to see me about?" asked Braddock crossly. He had been
      summoned by Cockatoo from the perusal of a new papyrus to see his visitor,
      and consequently was not in the best of tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've jes' blew in fur a trifle of chin-music," replied Hervey with an
      emphatic U.S.A. accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm busy: get out," was the uncomplimentary reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey took a chair and, stretching his lengthy legs, produced a black
      cheroot, as long and lean as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were in the States, Professor, I'd draw a bead on you for that
      style of lingo. I'm not taking any. See!" and he lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're the captain of 'The Diver'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so; I was, that is. Now, I've shifted to a dandy wind-jammer of
      sorts that can run rings round the old barky. I surmise I'm off for the
      South Seas, pearl-fishing, in three months. I'll take that Kanaka along
      with me, if y'like, Professor," and he cast a side glance at Cockatoo, who
      was squatting on his hams as usual, polishing a blue enameled jar from a
      Theban tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I require the services of the man," said Braddock stiffly. "As to you,
      sir: you've been paid for your business in connection with Bolton's
      passage and the shipment of my mummy, so there is no more to be said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaps more! heaps, you bet," remarked the man of the sea placidly, and
      controlling a temper which in less civilized parts would have led him to
      wipe the floor with the plump scientist. "My owners were paid fur that
      racket: not me. No, sir. So I've paddled into this port to see if I can
      rake in a few dollars on my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've no dollars to give you&mdash;in charity, that is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! An' who asked charity, you bald-headed jelly-bag?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock grew scarlet with fury. "If you speak to me like that, you
      ruffian, I'll throw you out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?&mdash;you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, me," and the Professor stood on tip-toe, like the bantam he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me smile, and likewise tired," murmured Hervey, admiring the
      little man's pluck. "See here, Professor, touching that mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mummy: my green mummy. What about it?" Braddock rose to the fly thrown
      by this skilful angler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so. What will you shell out if I pass along that corpse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" The Professor again stood on tip-toe, gasping and purple in the
      face. He almost squeaked in the extremity of his anger. "I knew it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knew what?" demanded the skipper, genuinely surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew that you had stolen my mummy. Yes, you needn't deny it. Bolton,
      like the silly fool he was, told you how valuable the mummy was, and you
      strangled the poor devil to get my property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go slow," said the captain, in no wise perturbed by this accusation. "I
      would have you remember that at the inquest it was stated that the window
      was locked and the door was open. How then could I waltz into that blamed
      hotel and arrange for a funeral? 'Sides, I guess shooting is mor'n my line
      than garrotting. I leave that to the East Coast Yellow-Stomachs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock sat down and wiped his face. He saw plainly enough that he had
      not a leg to stand on, as Hervey was plainly innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sides," went on the skipper, chewing his cheroot, "I guess if I'd wanted
      that old corpse of yours, I'd have yanked Bolton overside, and set down
      the accident to bad weather. Better fur me to loot the case aboard than to
      make a fool of myself ashore. No, sir, H.H. don't run 'is own perticler
      private circus in that blamed way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "H.H. Who the devil is H.H.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me, you bet. Hiram Hervey, citizen of the U.S.A. Nantucket neighborhood
      for home life. And see, don't you get m'hair riz, or I'll scalp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't scalp me," chuckled Braddock, passing his hand over a very bald
      head. "See here, what do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Name a price and I'll float round to get back your verdant corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were going to the South Seas?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In three months, pearl-fishing. Lots of time, I reckon, to run this old
      circus I want you to finance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any suspicions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, 'sept I don't believe in that window business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" Braddock sat upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," drawled the Yankee, "y'see, I interviewed the gal as told that
      perticler lie in court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eliza Flight. Was it a lie she told?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, not exactly. The window was snibbed, but that was done after the
      chap who sent your pal to Kingdom Come had got out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say that the window was locked from the outside?" asked
      Braddock, and then, when Hervey nodded, he exclaimed "Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Narry an impossibility, you bet. The chap who engineered the circus was
      all-fired smart. The snib was an old one, and he yanked a piece of string
      round it, and passed the string through the crack between the upper and
      lower sash of the window. When outside he pulled, and the snib slid into
      place. But he left the string on the ground outside. I picked it up nex'
      day and guessed the racket he'd been on. I tried the same business and
      brought off the deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds wonderful and yet impossible," cried Braddock, rubbing his bald
      head and walking excitedly to and fro. "See here, I'll come along with you
      and see how it's done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet you won't, unless you shell out. See here"&mdash;Hervey leaned
      forward&mdash;"from that window business it's plain that no one inside the
      shanty corpsed your pal. The chap as did it entered and left by the
      window, and made tracks with that old corp you want. Now you pass along
      five hundred pounds&mdash;that's English currency, I reckon&mdash;and I'll
      smell round for the robber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where do you think I can obtain five hundred pounds?" asked the
      Professor very dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I guess if that blamed corpse is worth it, you'll be willing to
      trade. Y'don't live in this shanty for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good friend, I have enough to live on, and obtain this house at a
      small rent on account of its isolation. But I can no more find the sum of
      five hundred pounds than fly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey rose and straightened his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I guess I'd best be getting back to Pierside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment, sir. Did anything happen on the voyage?&mdash;did Bolton say
      anything likely to lead you to suppose that he was in danger of being
      robbed and murdered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the skipper musingly, and pulling his goatee. "He told me that
      he had secured the old corpse, and was bringing it home to you. I didn't
      talk much to Bolton; he wasn't my style."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any idea who killed him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I ain't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how do you propose to find the criminal who has the mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You give me five hundred pounds and see," said Hervey coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't got the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I reckon you don't get the corpse. So long," and the skipper
      strolled towards the door. Braddock followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a clue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I've got nothing; not even that five hundred pounds you make such a
      fuss over. It's a wasted day with H.H., I surmise. Wait!" He scribbled on
      a card and flung it across the room. "That's my Pierside address if you
      should change your blamed mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor picked up the card. "The Sailor's Rest! What, are you
      stopping there?" Then, when Hervey nodded, he cried violently, "Why, I
      believe you have a clue, and stop at the hotel to follow it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe I do and maybe I don't," retorted the captain, opening the door
      with a jerk; "anyhow, I don't hunt for that corpse without the dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hiram Hervey departed, the Professor raged up and down the room so
      violently that Cockatoo was cowed by his anger. Apparently this American
      skipper knew of something which might lead to the discovery of the
      assassin and incidentally to the restoration of the green mummy to its
      rightful owner. But he would not make a move unless he was paid five
      hundred pounds, and Braddock did not know where to procure that amount.
      Having long since made himself acquainted with Hope's financial condition,
      he knew well that there was no chance of getting a second check in that
      quarter. Of course there was Random, whom he had heard casually had
      returned from his yachting cruise, and was now back again at the Fort. But
      Random was in love with Lucy, and would probably only give or lend the
      money on condition that the Professor helped him with his wooing. In that
      case, since Lucy was engaged to Hope, there would be some difficulty in
      altering present conditions. But having arrived at this point of his
      somewhat angry meditations, Braddock sent Cockatoo with a message to his
      step-daughter, saying that he wished to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll see if she really loves Hope," thought the Professor, rubbing his
      plump hands. "If she doesn't, there may be a chance of her throwing him
      over to become Lady Random. Then I can get the money. And indeed,"
      soliloquized the Professor virtuously, "I must point out to her that it is
      wrong of her to make a poor marriage, when she can gain a wealthy husband.
      I will only be doing my duty by my dear dead wife, by preventing her
      wedding poverty. But girls are so obstinate, and Lucy is a thorough girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      His amiable anxiety on behalf of Miss Kendal was only cut short by the
      entrance of the young lady herself. Professor Braddock then showed his
      hand too plainly by evincing a strong wish to conciliate her in every way.
      He procured her a seat: he asked after her health: he told her that she
      was growing prettier every day, and in all ways behaved so unlike his
      usual self, that Lucy became alarmed and thought that he had been
      drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why have you sent for me?" she asked, anxious to come to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha!" Braddock put his venerable head on one side like a roguish bird and
      smiled in an infantine manner. "I have good news for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the mummy?" she demanded innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, about flesh and blood, which you prefer. Sir Frank Random has arrived
      back at the Fort. There!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," was Miss Kendal's unexpected reply. "His yacht came to
      Pierside on the same afternoon as The Diver arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed!" said the Professor, struck by the coincidence, and with a
      stare. "How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Archie met Sir Frank the other day, and learned as much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" Braddock struck a tragic attitude. "Do you mean to say that those
      two young men speak to one another?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Why not? They are friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" Braddock became roguish again. "I fancied they were lovers of a
      certain young lady who is in this room."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Lucy was beginning to guess what her step-father was aiming
      at, and grew correspondingly angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Archie is my sole lover now," she remarked stiffly. "Sir Frank knows that
      we are engaged and is quite ready to be the friend of us both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he calls that love. Idiot!" cried the Professor, much disgusted. "But
      I would point out to you, Lucy&mdash;and I do so because of my deep
      affection for you, dear child&mdash;that Sir Frank is wealthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So is Archie&mdash;in my love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! nonsense! That is mere foolish romance, He has no money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should not say that. Archie had money to the extent of one thousand
      pounds, which he gave you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One thousand pounds: a mere nothing. Consider, Lucy, that if you marry
      Random you will have a title."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kendal, whose patience was getting exhausted, stamped a very neat
      boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why you talk in this way, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to see you happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your wish is granted: you do see me happy. But I won't be happy long
      if you keep bothering me to marry a man I don't care two straws about. I
      am going to be Mrs. Hope, so there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child," said the Professor, who always became paternal when most
      obstinate, "I have reason to believe that the green mummy can be
      discovered and poor Sidney's death avenged if a reward of five hundred
      pounds is offered. If Hope can give me that money&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not: I shall not allow him to. He has lost too much already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case I must apply to Sir Frank Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, apply," she snapped, being decidedly angry; "it's none of my
      business. I don't want to hear anything about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is your business, miss," cried Braddock, growing angry in his turn and
      becoming very pink; "you know that only by getting you to marry Random can
      I procure the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Lucy coldly. "So this is why you sent for me. Now, father, I
      have had enough of this. You gave your consent to Archie being engaged to
      me in exchange for one thousand pounds. As I love him I shall abide by the
      word you gave. If I had not loved him I should have refused to marry him.
      You understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand that I have a very obstinate girl to deal with. You shall
      marry as I choose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do nothing of the sort. You have no right to dictate my choice of
      a husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No right, when I am your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not my father: merely my step-father&mdash;merely a relation by
      marriage. I am of age. I can do as I like, and intend to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Lucy," implored Braddock, changing his tune, "think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have thought. I marry Archie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is poor and Random is rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care. I love Archie and I don't love Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you have me lose the mummy for ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I would, if my misery is to be the price of its restoration. Why
      should I sell myself to a man I care nothing about, just because you want
      a musty, fusty old corpse? Now I am going." Lucy walked to the door. "I
      shan't listen to another word. And if you bother me again, I shall marry
      Archie at once and leave the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can make you leave it in any case, you ungrateful girl," bellowed
      Braddock, who was purple with rage, never having a very good temper at the
      best of times. "Look what I have done for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kendal could have pointed out that her step-father had done nothing
      save attend to himself. But she disdained such an argument, and without
      another word opened the door and walked out. Almost immediately afterwards
      Cockatoo entered, much to the relief of the Professor, who relieved his
      feelings by kicking the unfortunate Kanaka. Then he sat down again to
      consider ways and means of obtaining the necessary mummy and still more
      necessary money.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE BARONET
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir Frank Random was an amiable young gentleman with&mdash;as the saying
      goes&mdash;all his goods in the shop window. Fair-haired and tall, with a
      well-knit, athletic figure, a polished manner, and a man-of-the-world air,
      he strictly resembled the romantic officer of Bow Bells, Family Herald,
      Young Ladies' Journal fiction. But the romance was all in his well-groomed
      looks, as he was as commonplace a Saxon as could be met with in a day's
      march. Fond of sport, attentive to his duties as artillery captain, and
      devoted to what is romantically known as the fair sex, he sauntered easily
      through life, very well contented with himself and with his agreeable
      surroundings. He read fiction when he did read, and those weekly papers
      devoted to sport; troubled his head very little about politics, save when
      they had to do with a possible German invasion, and was always ready to do
      any one a good turn. His brother-officers declared that he was not half a
      bad sort, which was high praise from the usually reticent service man. His
      capacity may be accurately gauged by the fact that he did not possess a
      single enemy, and that every one spoke well of him. A mortal who possesses
      no quality likely to be envied by those around him is certain to belong to
      the rank and file of humanity. But these unconsidered units of mankind can
      always console themselves with the undoubted fact that mediocrity is
      invariably happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a man as Random would never set the Thames on fire, and certainly he
      had no ambition to perform that astounding feat. He was fond of his
      profession and intended to remain in the army as long as he could. He
      desired to marry and beget a family, and retire, when set free from
      soldiering, to his country seat, and there perform blamelessly the
      congenial role of a village squire, until called upon to join the
      respectable corpses in the Random vault. Not that he was a saint or ever
      could be one. Neither black nor white, he was simply gray, being an
      ordinary mixture of good and bad. As theology has provided no hereafter
      for gray people, it is hard to imagine where the bulk of humanity will go.
      But doubts on this point never troubled Random. He went to church, kept
      his mouth shut and his pores open and vaguely believed that it would be
      all right somehow. A very comfortable if superficial philosophy indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can easily be guessed that Random's somewhat colorless personality
      would never attract Lucy Kendal, since the hues of her own character were
      deeper. For this reason she was drawn to Hope, who possessed that
      aggressive artistic temperament, where good and bad, are in violent
      contrast. Random took opinions from books, or from other people, and his
      mind, like a looking-glass, reflected whatever came along; but Hope
      possessed opinions of his own, both right and wrong, and held to these in
      the face of all verbal opposition. He could argue and did argue, when
      Random simply agreed. Lucy had similar idiosyncrasies, inherited from a
      clever father, so it was just as well that she preferred Archie to Frank.
      Had the latter young gentleman married her, he would have dwindled to Lady
      Random's husband, and would have found too late that he had domesticated a
      kind of imitation George Eliot. When he congratulated Archie on his
      engagement somewhat ruefully, he little thought what an escape he had had.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Professor Braddock, who did not belong to the gray tribe, knew nothing
      of this, as his Egyptological studies did not permit him time to argue on
      such commonplace matters. He therefore failed in advance when he set out
      to persuade Random into renewing his suit. As the fiery little man
      afterwards expressed himself, "I might as well have talked to a mollusc,"
      for Random politely declined to be used as an instrument to forward the
      Professor's ambition at the cost of Miss Kendal's unhappiness. The
      interview took place in Sir Frank's quarters at the Fort on the day after
      Hervey had called to propose a search for the corpse. And it was during
      this interview that Braddock learned something which both startled and
      annoyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random, at three o'clock, had just changed into mufti, when the Professor
      was announced by his servant. Braddock, determined to give his host no
      chance of denying himself, followed close on the man's heels, and was in
      the room almost before Sir Frank had read the card. It was a bare room,
      sparsely furnished, according to the War Office's idea of comfort, and
      although the baronet had added a few more civilized necessities, it still
      looked somewhat dismal. Braddock, who liked comfort, shook hands
      carelessly with his host and cast a disapproving eye on his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dog kennel! dog kennel!" grumbled the polite Professor. "Bare desolation
      like a damned dungeon. You might as well live in the Sahara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would certainly be warmer," replied Random, who knew the scientist's
      snappy ways very well. "Take a chair, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard as bricks, confound it! Hand me over a cushion. There, that's
      better! No, I never drink between meals, thank you. Smoke? Hang it,
      Random, you should know by this time that I dislike making a chimney of my
      throat! There! there! don't fuss. Take a seat and listen to what I have to
      say. It's important. Poke the fire, please: it's cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random placidly did as he was told, and then lighted a cigar, as he sat
      down quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to hear of your trouble, sir.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble! trouble! What particular trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The death of your assistant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes. Silly young ass to get killed. Lost my mummy, too: there's
      trouble if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The green mummy." Random looked into the fire, "Yes. I have heard of the
      green mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think you have," snapped Braddock, warming his plump hands.
      "Every penny-a-liner has been talking about it. When did you return?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the same day that that steamer with the mummy on board arrived," was
      Random's odd reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor stared suspiciously. "I don't see why you should date your
      movements by my mummy," he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I had a reason in doing so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What reason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mummy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about it?&mdash;do you know where it is?" Braddock started to his
      feet, and looked eagerly at the calm face of his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I wish I did. How much did you pay for it, Professor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that to you?" snapped the other, resuming his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing at all. But it is a great deal to Don Pedro de Gayangos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who the deuce is he? Some Spanish Egyptologist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he is an Egyptologist, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must be, if he wants my mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget, Professor, that the green mummy comes from Peru."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who denied that it did, sir? You are illogical&mdash;infernally so." The
      little man rose and straddled on the hearth-rug, with his back to the fire
      and his hands under his coat-tails. "Now, sir," he said, glaring at the
      young man like a school-master&mdash;"what the deuce are you talking
      about? Out with it: no evasion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hang it, Professor, don't jump down my throat, spurs and all," said
      Random, rather annoyed by this dictatorial tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never wear spurs: go on, sir, and don't argue."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Frank could not help laughing, although he knew that it was useless to
      induce Braddock to be civil. Not that the Professor, meant to be rude,
      especially as he desired to conciliate Random. But long years of fighting
      with other scientists and of having his own scientific way had turned him
      into a kind of school-master, and every one knows that they are the most
      domineering of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a long story," said the baronet, with a shrug and a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Story! story! What story?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That which I am about to tell you." And then
    </p>
    <p>
      Random began hurriedly, so as to prevent further arguments of an
      unprofitable kind. "I was at Genoa with my yacht, and there stopped on
      shore at the Casa Bianca."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What place is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An hotel. I there met with a certain Don Pedro de Gayangos and his
      daughter, Donna Inez, He was a gentleman from Lima, and had come to Europe
      in search of the green mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did this confounded Spaniard want with my green mummy?" he
      demanded indignantly. "How did he know of its existence?&mdash;what reason
      had he to try and obtain it? Answer, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall let Don Pedro answer himself," said Random dryly. "He arrives in
      a couple of days, and intends to take rooms at the Warrior Inn along with
      his daughter. Then you can question him, Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I question you," snapped Braddock angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I am answering to the best of my ability. Don Pedro told me nothing
      beyond the fact that he wanted the mummy, and had come to Europe to get
      it. In some way he learned that it was in Malta and was for sale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so: quite so," rasped the Professor. "He saw the advertisement in
      the newspapers, as I did, and wanted to buy it over my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he wanted to buy it right enough, and wired to Malta," said Random,
      "but in reply he received a letter stating that it had been sold to you
      and was being taken to England on The Diver. I followed The Diver in my
      yacht and arrived at Pierside an hour after she did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" Braddock glared. "I begin to see light. This infernal Spaniard was
      on board, and wanted my mummy. He knew that Bolton had taken it to the
      Sailor's Rest and went there to kill the poor lad and get my&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the sort," interrupted Sir Frank impatiently. "Don Pedro
      remained behind in Genoa, intending to write and ask if you would sell him
      the mummy. I wrote and told him of the murder of your assistant and
      related all that had happened. He wired to me that he was coming to
      England at once, as&mdash;as I told you. He will be in Gartley in a couple
      of days. That is the whole story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a sufficiently strange one," grumbled Braddock, frowning. "What
      does he want with my mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell you. But if you will sell&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sell! sell! sell!" vociferated Braddock furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro will give you a good price," finished Random calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't got the mummy," said the Professor, sitting down and wiping his
      pink head, "and if I had, I certainly would not sell. However, I'll hear
      what this gentleman has to say when he arrives. Perhaps he can throw some
      light on the mystery of this crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am perfectly certain that he cannot, sir. Don Pedro&mdash;as I said&mdash;was
      left behind in Genoa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said the Professor, unconvinced. "He could easily employ a third
      party."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random rose, looking and feeling annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you that Don Pedro is a gentleman and a man of honor. He would
      not stoop to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! there!" Braddock waved his hands. "Sit down: sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't say such things, Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say what I desire to say," retorted the old gentleman tartly; "but we
      can dismiss the subject for the time being."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only too glad to do so," said Random, who was ruffled out of his
      usual calm by the veiled accusation which Braddock had brought against his
      foreign friend, "and to get to a more agreeable subject, tell me how Miss
      Kendal is keeping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is ill, very ill," said the Professor solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ill? Why, Hope, whom I met the other day, said that she was feeling very
      well and very happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Hope thinks, because he has forced her into an engagement."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random started to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forced her? Nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't nonsense, and don't dare to speak like that to me, sir. I repeat
      that Lucy&mdash;poor child&mdash;is breaking her heart for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stared and then broke into a hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, sir, but that is impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't, confound you!" said Braddock, who did not like being laughed
      at. "I know women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know your daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Step-daughter, you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, perhaps the more distant relationship accounts for your ignorance of
      her character," said Random dryly. "You are quite wrong. I was in love
      with Miss Kendal, and asked her to be my wife before I went on leave. She
      refused me, saying that she loved Hope, and because of her refusal I took
      my broken heart to Monte Carlo, where I lost much more money than I had
      any right to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your broken heart seems to have mended quickly," said Braddock, who was
      trying to suppress his wrath at this instance of Lucy's duplicity, for so
      he considered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, pooh, it's only my way of speaking," laughed the young man. "If my
      heart had been really broken I should not have mentioned the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you did not love Lucy, and you dared to play fast and loose with her
      affections," raged Braddock, stamping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite wrong," said Sir Frank sharply; "I did love Miss Kendal, or
      I should certainly not have asked her to be my wife. But when she told me
      that she loved another man, I stood aside as any fellow would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should have insisted on&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On nothing, sir. I am not the man to force a woman to give me a heart
      which belongs to another person. I am very glad that Miss Kendal is
      engaged to Hope, as he is a capital fellow, and will make her a better
      husband than I ever could have made her. Besides," Random shrugged his
      shoulders, "one nail drives another out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! That means you love another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not bound to tell you my private affairs, Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so: quite so; but Inez is a pretty and romantic name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you are talking about, sir," said Random stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock chuckled, having read the truth in the flush which had crept over
      Random's tanned face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask your pardon," he said elaborately. "I am an old man, and I was your
      father's friend. You must not mind if I have been a trifle inquisitive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say no more, sir: that is all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't agree with you, Random. Things are not all right and never will
      be until my mummy is discovered. Now you can help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?" asked the other uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With money. Understand, my boy," added the Professor in a genial way
      which he knew well how to assume, "I should have preferred Lucy becoming
      your wife. However, since she prefers Hope, there's no more to be said on
      that score. I therefore will not make the offer I came here to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An offer, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! I fancied that you loved Lucy and were broken-hearted by the news of
      her engagement to Hope. I therefore intended to ask you to give me, or
      rather lend me, five hundred pounds on condition that I helped you to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Professor," said Random, coloring, "I should never have bought Miss
      Kendal as my wife on those terms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course! of course! and&mdash;as I say&mdash;there is no more to be
      said. I shall therefore agree to Lucy's engagement to Hope"&mdash;Braddock
      carefully omitted to say that he had already agreed and had been paid one
      thousand pounds to agree&mdash;"and will congratulate you when you lead
      Donna Inez to the altar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said anything about Donna Inez, Professor Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not: modern reticence. However, I can see through a brick wall
      as well as most people. I understand, so let us drop the subject, my boy.
      And this five hundred pounds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot lend it to you, Professor. The fact is, I lost heaps of coin at
      Monte Carlo, and am not in a position to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, let us shelve that also," said Braddock with apparent
      heartiness, although he was really very angry at his failure. "I am sorry,
      though, as I wish to get back the mummy and to revenge poor Sidney
      Bolton's death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can the five hundred do that?" asked Random with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," drawled the Professor with his eyes on the young man's attentive
      face, "Captain Hervey of The Diver came to me yesterday and proposed to
      search for the assassin and his plunder on condition that I paid him five
      hundred pounds. I am, as you know, very poor for a scientist, and so I
      wished to borrow the five hundred from you on condition that Lucy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't talk of that again," said Random hurriedly; "but do you mean to
      say that this Captain Hervey knows of anything likely to solve this
      mystery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says that he does not, and merely proposes to search. From what I have
      seen of the man I should think that he had all the capacities of a good
      bloodhound and would certainly succeed. But he will not move a step
      without money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five hundred pounds," murmured Random thoughtfully, while the Professor
      watched him closely. "I can tell you how to obtain it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro seems to be rich, and he wants the mummy," said the baronet.
      "So when he comes here ask him to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not: certainly not," raged Braddock, clapping on his hat in a
      fury. "How dare you make such a proposition to me, Random! If this Don
      Pedro offers the reward and Hervey finds the mummy, he will simply hand it
      over to your friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can scarcely do that, since you have bought the mummy. But Don Pedro
      is willing to purchase it from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" Braddock moved to the door, thinking. "I shall reserve my
      decision until this man arrives. Good day," and he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random did not attempt to detain him, as he was somewhat weary of the
      Professor's vagaries. He knew very well that Braddock would call on Don
      Pedro when he came to the Warrior Inn, and join forces with him in
      searching for the lost goods. And the train of thought initiated by the
      Professor's visit led Random to a certain drawer, whence he took the
      photograph of a splendid-looking beauty. To this he pressed his lips. "I
      wonder if your father will give you to me in exchange for that mummy," he
      thought, and kissed the pictured face again.

      CHAPTER IX. MRS. JASHER'S LUCK'
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some weeks had now elapsed since the death and burial of Sidney Bolton,
      and the excitement had simmered down to a gentle speculation as to who had
      killed him. This question was discussed in a half-hearted manner round the
      winter fires of Gartley, but gradually people were ceasing to interest
      themselves in a crime, the mystery of which would apparently never be
      solved. Life went on in the village and at the Pyramids much in the same
      way, save that the Professor attended along with Cockatoo to his museum
      and did not engage another assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie and Lucy were perfectly happy, as they looked forward to being
      married in the spring, and Braddock showed no desire to interfere with
      their engagement. They knew, of course, that he had called upon Sir Frank,
      but were ignorant of what had taken place. Random himself called at the
      Pyramids to congratulate Miss Kendal on her engagement, and seemed so very
      pleased that she was going to marry the man of her choice, that,
      woman-like, she grew rather annoyed. As the baronet had been her lover,
      she thought that he should wear the willow for her sake. But Random showed
      no disposition to do so, therefore Lucy shrewdly guessed that his broken
      heart had been mended by another woman. The Professor could have confirmed
      the truth of this from the hints which Random had given him, but he said
      nothing about his interview with the young man, nor did he mention that a
      Spanish gentleman from Peru was seeking for the famous green mummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considerably vexed that Random should be so cheerful, Lucy cast round to
      learn the truth. She could scarcely ask the baronet himself, and Archie
      professed himself unable to explain. Miss Kendal did not dream of
      cross-examining Braddock, as it never entered her mind that the
      dry-as-dust scientist would know anything. It then occurred to this
      inquisitive young lady that Mrs. Jasher might be aware of Random's secret,
      which made him so cheerful. Sir Frank was a great friend of the plump
      widow, and frequently went to take afternoon tea at her small house, which
      was situated no great distance from the Fort. In fact, Mrs. Jasher
      entertained the officers largely, as she was hospitable by nature, and
      liked to have presentable men about her for flirting purposes. With
      good-looking youth she assumed the maternal air, and in the role of a
      clever woman of the world professed to be the adviser of one and all. In
      this way she became quite a favorite, and her little parlor&mdash;she
      liked the old English word&mdash;was usually, well filled at the hour of
      afternoon tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice already Lucy had called on Mrs. Jasher after the commotion caused by
      the crime, as she wished to speak to her about the same; but on each
      occasion the widow proved to be absent in London. However, the third visit
      proved to be more lucky, for Mrs. Jasher was at home, and expressed
      herself happy to see the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So good of you to come and see me in my little wooden hut," said the
      widow, kissing her guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Jasher's cottage really was a little wooden hut, being what was
      left of an old-fashioned farmhouse, built before the stone age. It lay on
      the verge of the marshes in an isolated position and was placed in the
      middle of a square garden, protected from the winter floods by a low stone
      wall solidly built, but of no great height. The road to the Fort ran past
      the front part of the garden, but behind the marshes spread towards the
      embankment, which cut off the view of the Thames. The situation was not an
      ideal one, nor was the cottage, but money was scarce with Mrs. Jasher, and
      she had obtained the whole place at a surprisingly small rental. The house
      and grounds were dry enough in summer, but decidedly damp in winter.
      Therefore, the widow went to a flat in London, as a rule, for the season
      of fogs. But this winter she had made up her mind&mdash;so she told Lucy&mdash;to
      remain in her own little castle and brave the watery humors of the
      marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can always keep fires burning in every room," said Mrs. Jasher, when
      she had removed her guest's hat and had settled her for a confidential
      talk on the sofa. "And after all, my dear, there is no place like home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was small, and Mrs. Jasher was small, so she suited her
      surroundings excellently. Also, the widow had the good taste to furnish it
      sparsely, instead of crowding it with furniture; but what furniture there
      was could not be improved upon. There were Chippendale chairs, a Louis
      Quinze table, a Sheridan cabinet, and a satin-wood desk, hand-painted,
      which was said to have been the property of the unhappy Marie Antoinette.
      Oil-paintings adorned the rose-tinted walls, chiefly landscapes, although
      one or two were portraits. Also, there were water-colored pictures, framed
      and signed caricatures, many plates of old china, and rice-paper
      adornments from Canton. The room was essentially feminine, being filled
      with Indian stuffs, with silver oddments, with flowers, and with other
      trifles. The walls, the carpet, the hangings, and the upholstery of the
      arm-chairs were all of a rosy hue, so that Mrs. Jasher looked as young as
      Dame Holda in the Venusberg. A very pretty room and a very charming
      hostess, was the verdict of the young gentlemen from the Fort, who came
      here to flirt when they were not serving their country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher in a tea-rose tea-gown for afternoon tea&mdash;she always
      liked to be in keeping&mdash;rang for that beverage dear to the feminine
      heart, and lighted a rose-shaded lamp. When a glow as of dawn spread
      through the dainty room, she settled Lucy on the sofa near the fire, and
      drew up an arm-chair on the other side of the hearth-rug. Outside it was
      cold and foggy, but the rose-hued curtains shut out all that was
      disagreeable in the weather, and in the absence of male society, the two
      women talked more or less confidentially. Lucy did not dislike Mrs.
      Jasher, even though she fancied that the lively widow was planning to
      become the mistress of the Pyramids.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear girl," said Mrs. Jasher, shading her face from the fire
      with a large fan, "and how is your dear father after his late terrible
      experiences?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is perfectly well, and rather cross," replied Lucy, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cross?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. He has lost that wretched mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And poor Sidney Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't think he cares for poor Sidney's death beyond the fact that
      he misses his services. But the mummy cost nine hundred pounds, and father
      is much annoyed, especially as Peruvian mummies are somewhat hard to
      obtain. You see, Mrs. Jasher, father wishes to see the difference between
      the Peruvian and Egyptian modes of embalming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh! How gruesome!" Mrs. Jasher shuddered. "But has anything been
      discovered likely to show who killed this poor lad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the whole thing is a mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher looked into the fire over the top of the fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read the papers," she said slowly, "and have gathered what I could
      from what the reporters explained. But I intend to call on the Professor
      and hear all that evidence which did not get into the papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that everything has been made public. The police have no clue to
      the murderer. Why do you want to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher made a movement of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I am the Professor's friend, of course, my dear, and naturally I
      want to help him to solve this mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no chance, so far as I can see, of it ever being solved," said
      Lucy. "It's very sweet of you, of course, but were I you I should not talk
      about it to my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Mrs. Jasher quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he thinks of nothing else, and both Archie and I are trying to
      get him off the subject. The mummy is lost and poor Sidney is buried.
      There is no more to be said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, if a reward was offered&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father is too poor to offer a reward, and the Government will not do
      so. And as people will not work without money, why&mdash;" Lucy completed
      her sentence with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might offer a reward if the dear Professor will let me," said the widow
      unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! But I thought that you were poor, as we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was, and I am not very rich now. All the same, I have come in for some
      thousands of pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I congratulate you. A legacy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You remember how I told you about my brother who was a Pekin
      merchant. He is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am so sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, what is the use of being sorry. I never cry over spilt milk, or
      assume a virtue which I have not. My brother and I were almost strangers,
      as we lived apart for so many years. However, he came home to die at
      Brighton, and a few weeks ago&mdash;just after this murder took place, in
      fact&mdash;I was summoned to his death-bed. He lingered on until last week
      and died in my arms. He left me nearly all his money, so I will be able to
      help the Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why you should," said Lucy, wondering why Mrs. Jasher did not
      wear mourning for the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, you do see," remarked the widow, raising her eyes and rubbing her
      plump hands together. "I want to marry your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy did not express astonishment, as she had understood this for a long
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guessed as much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kendal shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my step-father," she emphasized the word&mdash;"if my step-father
      consents, why should I mind? I am going to marry Archie, and no doubt the
      Professor will be lonely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you do not disapprove of me as a mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mrs. Jasher," said Lucy, coldly, "there is no relationship
      between me and my step-father beyond the fact that he married my mother.
      Therefore you can never be my mother. Were I stopping on at the Pyramids,
      that question might arise, but as I become Mrs. Hope in six months, we can
      be friends&mdash;nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite content with that," said Mrs. Jasher in a businesslike way.
      "After all, I am no sentimentalist. But I am glad that you do not mind my
      marrying the Professor, as I don't want you to prevent the match, my
      dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you that I have no influence with my father, Mrs. Jasher. He
      will marry you if he thinks fit and without consulting me. But," added the
      girl with emphasis, "I do not see what you gain in becoming Mrs.
      Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may become Lady Braddock," said the widow, dryly. Then, in answer to
      the open astonishment on Lucy's face, she hastened to remark: "Do you mean
      to say that you don't know your father is heir to a baronetcy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know that," rejoined Miss Kendal. "The Professor's brother, Sir
      Donald Braddock, is an old man and unmarried. If he dies without heirs, as
      it seems likely, the Professor will certainly take the title."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, there you are!" cried Mrs. Jasher, in her liveliest tone. "I
      want to give my legacy for the title and preside over a scientific salon
      in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand. But you will never get my father to live in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait until I marry him," said the little woman shrewdly. "I'll make a man
      of him. I know, of course, that mummies and sepulchral ornaments and those
      sort of horrid things are dull, but the Professor will become Sir Julian
      Braddock, and that is enough for me. I don't love him, of course, as love
      between two elderly people is absurd, but I shall make him a good wife,
      and with my money he can take his proper position in the scientific world,
      which he doesn't occupy at present. I would rather he had been artistic,
      as science is so dull. However, I am getting on in years and wish to have
      some amusement before I die, so I must take what I can get. What do you
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite agreeable, as, when I leave, someone must look after my
      father, else he will be shamefully robbed by everyone in household
      matters. We are good friends, so why not you as well as another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a dear girl," said Mrs. Jasher with a sigh of relief, and kissed
      Lucy fondly. "I am sure we shall get on excellently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a distance. The artistic world doesn't touch on the scientific, you
      know. And you forget, Mrs. Jasher, that my father wishes to go to Egypt to
      explore this mysterious tomb."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I promised, when I came in for my brother's money, to help the
      Professor to fit out his expedition. But it seems to me that the money
      will be better spent in offering a reward so that the mummy can be found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Lucy, laughing, "you can give the Professor his choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before marriage, not after. He needs to be managed, like all men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not find him easy to manage," said Lucy dryly. "He is a very
      obstinate man, and quite feminine in his persistency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "H'm! I recognize that he is a difficult character, and between you and me
      dear, I should not marry him but for the title. It sounds rather like an
      adventuress talking in this way, but, after all, if he makes me Lady
      Braddock I can give him enough money to let him realize his desire of
      getting the mummy back. It's six of one and half a dozen of the other. And
      I'll be good to him: you need not fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite sure that, good or bad, the Professor will have his own way.
      It is not his happiness I am thinking of so much as yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really. Here is the tea. Put the table near the fire, Jane, between Miss
      Kendal and myself. Thank you. The muffins on the fender. Thank you. No,
      there is nothing more. Close the door when you go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea equippage having been arranged, Mrs. Jasher poured out a cup of
      Souchong, and handed it to her guest, resuming the subject of her proposed
      marriage meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why you should be anxious about me, dear. I am quite able to
      look after myself. And the Professor seems to be kind-hearted enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he is kind-hearted when he gets his own way. Give him his hobby and
      he will never bother you. But he won't live in London, and he will not
      consent to this salon you wish to institute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? It means fame to him. I shall gather round me all the scientists
      of London and make my house a centre of interest. The Professor can stop
      in his laboratory if he likes. As his wife, I can do all that is
      necessary. Well, my dear"&mdash;Mrs. Jasher took a cup of tea&mdash;"we
      need not talk the subject threadbare. You do not disapprove of my marriage
      with your step-father, so you can leave the rest to me. If you can give me
      a hint of how to proceed to bring about this marriage, of course I am not
      above taking it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy glanced at the tea-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you will have to tell the Professor that your brother is dead to
      account for possessing the money," she said pointedly, "I should advise
      you to go into mourning. Professor Braddock will be shocked otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, what a tender heart he must have!" said Mrs. Jasher flippantly.
      "My brother was very little to me, poor man, so he cannot be anything to
      the Professor. However, I shall adopt your advice, and, after all, black
      suits me very well. There"&mdash;she swept her hands across the tea-table&mdash;"that
      is settled. Now about yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Archie and I marry in the springtime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your other admirer, who has come back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Frank Random?" said Lucy, coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. He called to see me a day or so ago, and seems less
      broken-hearted than he should be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy nodded and colored still deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose some other woman has consoled him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Catch a modern man wearing the willow for any girl, however
      dear. Are you angry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, yes, I think," said the widow, laughing, "else you are no woman,
      my dear. I know I should be angry to see a man get over his rejection so
      rapidly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is she?" asked Lucy abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Donna Inez de Gayangos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Spaniard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so&mdash;a colonial Spaniard, at least&mdash;from Lima. Her
      father, Don Pedro de Gayangos, met Sir Frank in Genoa by chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" demanded Lucy impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher shrugged her plump shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, can't you put two and two together. Of course Sir Frank
      fell in love with this dark-hued angel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dark-hued! and I am light-haired. What a compliment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps Sir Frank wanted a change. He played on white and lost, and
      therefore stakes his money on black to win. That's the result of having
      been at Monte Carlo. Besides, this young lady is rich, I understand, and
      Sir Frank&mdash;so he told me&mdash;lost much more money at Monte Carlo
      than he could afford. Well, you don't look pleased."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy roused herself from a fit of abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, I am pleased, of course. I suppose, as any woman would, I felt
      rather hurt for the moment in being forgotten so soon. But, after all, I
      can't blame Sir Frank for consoling himself. If I am married first, he
      shall dance at my wedding: if he is married first, I shall dance at his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you shall both dance at mine," said Mrs. Jasher. "Why, there is quite
      an epidemic of matrimony. Well, Donna Inez arrives here with her father in
      a day, or so. They stop at the Warrior Inn, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That horrid place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is clean and respectable. Besides, Sir Frank can hardly ask them
      to stop in the Fort, and I have no room in this bandbox of mine. However,
      the two of them&mdash;Donna Inez and Frank, I mean&mdash;can come here and
      flirt; so can you and Archie if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear four people in this room would not do," laughed Lucy, rising to
      take her leave. "Well, I hope Sir Frank will marry this lady and that you
      will become Mrs. Braddock. Only one thing I should like to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why was the mummy stolen. It was not valuable save to a scientist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By that argument a scientist must be the murderer and thief," said Mrs.
      Jasher. "However, we shall see. Meanwhile, live every moment of love's
      golden hours: they never return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is good advice; I shall take it and my leave," said Lucy, and
      departed in a very happy frame of mind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE DON AND HIS DAUGHTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Professor Braddock was usually the most methodical of men, and timed his
      life by the clock and the almanac. He rose at seven, summer and winter, to
      partake of a hearty breakfast, which served him until dinner came at five
      thirty. Braddock dined at this unusual hour&mdash;save when there was
      company&mdash;as he did not eat any luncheon and scorned the very idea of
      afternoon tea. Two meals a day, he maintained, was enough for any man who
      led a sedentary life, as too much food was apt to clog the wheels of the
      intellect. He usually worked in his museum&mdash;if the indulgence of his
      hobby could be called work&mdash;from nine until four, after which hour he
      took a short walk in the garden or through the village. On finishing his
      dinner he would glance over some scientific publication, or perhaps, by
      way of recreation, play a game or two of patience; but at seven he
      invariably retired into his own rooms to renew work. Retirement to bed
      took place at midnight, so it can be guessed that the Professor got
      through an enormous quantity of work during the year. A more methodical
      man, or a more industrious man did not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on occasions even this enthusiast wearied of his hobby, and of the
      year's routine. A longing to see brother scientists of his own way of
      thinking would seize him, and he would abruptly depart for London, to
      occupy quiet lodgings, and indulge in intercourse with his fellow-men.
      Braddock rarely gave early intimation of his urban nostalgia. At breakfast
      he would suddenly announce that the fit took him to go to London, and he
      would drive to Jessum along with Cockatoo to catch the ten o'clock train
      to London. Sometimes he sent the Kanaka back; at other times he would take
      him to town; but whether Cockatoo remained or departed, the museum was
      always locked up lest it should be profaned by the servants of the house.
      As a matter of fact, Braddock need not have been afraid, for Lucy&mdash;knowing
      her step-father's whims and violent temper&mdash;took care that the
      sanctity of the place should remain inviolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the Professor came back in a couple of days; at times his
      absence would extend to a week; and on two or three occasions he remained
      absent for a fortnight. But whenever he returned, he said very little
      about his doings to Lucy, perhaps deeming that dry scientific details
      would not appeal to a lively young lady. As soon as he was established in
      his museum again, life at the Pyramids would resume its usual routine,
      until Braddock again felt the want of a change. The wonder was,
      considering the nature of his work, and the closeness of his application,
      that he did not more often indulge in these Bohemian wanderings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, therefore, was not astonished when, on the morning after her visit
      to Mrs. Jasher, the Professor announced in his usual abrupt way that he
      intended to go to London, but would leave Cockatoo in charge of his
      precious collection. She was somewhat disturbed, however, as, wishing to
      forward the widow's matrimonial aims, she had invited her to dinner for
      the ensuing night. This she told her step-father, and, rather to her
      surprise, he expressed himself sorry that he could not remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jasher," said Braddock hastily, drinking his coffee, "is a very
      sensible woman, who knows when to be silent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is also a good housekeeper, I believe," hinted Miss Kendal demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, what? Well? Why do you say that?" snapped Braddock sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy fenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jasher admires you, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock grunted, but did not seem displeased, since even a scientist
      possessing the usual vanity of the male is not inaccessible to flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Mrs. Jasher tell you this?" he inquired, smiling complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in so many words. Still, I am a woman, and can guess how much another
      woman leaves unsaid." Lucy paused, then added significantly: "I do not
      think that she is so very old, and you must admit that she is wonderfully
      well preserved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a mummy," remarked the Professor absently; then pushed back his
      chair to add briskly: "What does all this mean, you minx? I know that the
      woman is all right so far as a woman can be: but her confounded age and
      her looks and her unexpressed admiration. What are these to an old man
      like myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," said Lucy earnestly, "when I marry Archie I shall, in all
      probability, leave Gartley for London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know&mdash;I know. Bless me, child, do you think that I have not
      thought of that? If you were only wise, which you are not, you would marry
      Random and remain at the Fort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Frank has other fish to fry, father. And even if I did remain at the
      Fort as his wife, I still could not look after you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! I am beginning to see what you are driving at. But I can't forget
      your mother, my dear. She was a good wife to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still," said Lucy coaxingly, and becoming more and more the champion of
      Mrs. Jasher, "you cannot manage this large house by yourself. I do not
      like to leave you in the hands of servants when I marry. Mrs. Jasher is
      very domesticated and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would make a good housekeeper. No, no, I don't want to give you
      another mother, child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no danger of that, even if I did not marry," rejoined Lucy
      stiffly. "A girl can have only one mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a man apparently can have two wives," said Braddock with dry humor.
      "Humph!"&mdash;he pinched his plump chin&mdash;"it's not a bad idea. But
      of course I can't fall in love at my age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that Mrs. Jasher asks for impossibilities."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor rose briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll think over it," said he. "Meanwhile, I am going to London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will you be back, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say. Don't ask silly questions. I dislike being bound to time. I
      may be a week, and I may be only a few days. Things can go on here as
      usual, but if Hope comes to see you, ask Mrs. Jasher in, to play
      chaperon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy consented to this suggestion, and Braddock went away to prepare for
      his departure. To get him off the premises was like launching a ship, as
      the entire household was at his swift heels, packing boxes, strapping
      rugs, cutting sandwiches, helping him on with his overcoat and assisting
      him into the trap, which had been hastily sent for to the Warrior Inn. All
      the time Braddock talked and scolded and gave directions and left
      instructions, until every one was quite bewildered. Lucy and the servants
      all sighed with relief when they saw the trap disappear round the end of
      the road in the direction of Jessum. In addition to being a famous
      archaeologist, the Professor was assuredly a great nuisance to those who
      had to do with his whims and fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next two or three days Lucy enjoyed herself in a quiet way with
      Archie. In spite of the lateness of the season, the weather was still
      fine, and the artist took the opportunity of the pale sunshine to sketch a
      great deal of the marsh scenery. Lucy attended him as a rule when he went
      abroad, and sometimes Mrs. Jasher, voluble and merry, would come along
      with them to play the part of chaperon. But the girl noticed that Mrs.
      Jasher's merriment was forced at times, and in the searching morning light
      she appeared to be quite old. Wrinkles showed themselves on her plump face
      and weary lines appeared round her mouth. Also, she was absent-minded
      while the lovers chattered, and, when spoken to, would return to the
      present moment with a start. As the widow was now well off as regards
      money, and as her scheme to marry Braddock was well on the way to success&mdash;for
      Lucy had duly reported the Professor's attitude&mdash;it was difficult to
      understand why Mrs. Jasher should look so worried. One day Lucy spoke to
      her on the subject. Random had strolled across the marshes to look at Hope
      sketch, and the two men chatted together, while Miss Kendal led the little
      widow to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing the matter, I hope," said Lucy gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Why do you say that?" asked Mrs. Jasher, flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been looking worried for the last few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a few troubles," sighed the widow&mdash;"troubles connected with
      the estate of my late brother. The lawyers are very disagreeable and make
      all sorts of difficulties to swell their costs. Then, strangely enough, I
      am beginning to feel my brother's death more than I thought I should have
      done. You see that I am in mourning, dear. After what you said the other
      day I felt that it was wrong for me not to wear mourning. Of course my
      poor brother and I were almost strangers. All the same, as he has left me
      money and was my only relative, I think it right to show some grief. I am
      a lonely woman, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When my father comes back you will no longer be lonely," said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope not. I feel that I want a man to look after me. I told you that I
      desired to marry the Professor for his possible title and in order to form
      a salon and have some amusement and power. But also I want a companion for
      my old age. There is no denying," added Mrs. Jasher with another sigh,
      "that I am growing old in spite of all the care I take. I am grateful for
      your friendship, dear. At one time I thought that you did not like me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think we get on very well together," said Lucy somewhat evasively,
      for she did not want to say that she would make the widow an intimate
      friend, "and, as you know, I am quite pleased that you should marry my
      step-father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So pleasant to think that you look at my ambition in that light," said
      Mrs. Jasher, patting the girl's arm. "When does the Professor return?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say. He refused to fix a date. But he usually remains away for a
      fortnight. I expect him back in that time, but he may come much earlier.
      He will come back when the fancy takes him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall alter all that, when we are married," muttered Mrs. Jasher with a
      frown. "He must be taught to be less selfish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear you will never improve him in that respect," said Lucy dryly, and
      rejoined the gentlemen in time to hear Random mention the name of Don
      Pedro de Gayangos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that, Sir Frank?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random turned toward her with his pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Spanish friend, whom I met at Genoa, is coming here to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With his daughter?" questioned Mrs. Jasher roguishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," replied the young soldier, coloring. "Donna Inez is quite
      devoted to her father and never leaves him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will one day, I expect," said Hope innocently, for his eyes were on
      his sketch and not on Random's face, "when the husband of her choice comes
      along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he has come along already," tittered Mrs. Jasher significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy took pity on Random's confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where will they stay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the Warrior Inn. I have engaged the best rooms in the place. I fancy
      they will be comfortable there, as Mrs. Humber, the landlady, is a good
      housekeeper and an excellent cook. And I don't think Don Pedro is hard to
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Spaniard, you say," remarked Archie idly. "Does he speak English?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirably&mdash;so does the daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why does a Spaniard come to so out-of-the-way a place?" asked Mrs.
      Jasher, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I told you the other day, when we spoke of the matter,"
      answered Sir Frank with surprise. "Don Pedro has come here to interview
      Professor Braddock about that missing mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope looked up sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he know about the mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing so far as I know, save that he came to Europe with the intention
      of purchasing it, and found himself forestalled by Professor Braddock. Don
      Pedro told me no more than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" murmured Hope to himself. "Don Pedro will be disappointed when he
      learns that the mummy is missing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random did not catch the words and was about to ask him what he had said,
      when two tall figures, conducted by a shorter one, were seen moving on the
      white road which led to the Fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strangers!" said Mrs. Jasher, putting up her lorgnette, which she used
      for effect, although she had remarkably keen sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?" asked Lucy carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, look how oddly the man is dressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell at this distance," said Lucy, "and if you can, Mrs. Jasher I
      really do not see why you require glasses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher laughed at the compliment to her sight, and colored through
      her rouge at the reproof to her vanity. Meanwhile, the smaller figure,
      which was that of a village lad leading a tall gentleman and a slender
      lady, pointed toward the group round Hope's easel. Shortly, the boy ran
      back up to the village road, and the gentleman came along the pathway with
      the lady. Random, who had been looking at them intently, suddenly started,
      having at length recognized them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro and his daughter," he said in an astonished voice, and sprang
      forward to welcome the unexpected visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear," whispered the widow in Lucy's ear, "we shall see the kind
      of woman Sir Frank prefers to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as Sir Frank has seen the kind of man I prefer to him," retorted
      Lucy, "that makes us quite equal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad these new-comers talk English," said Hope, who had risen to his
      feet. "I know nothing of Spanish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are not Spanish, but Peruvian," said Mrs. Jasher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The language is the same, more or less. Confound it! here is Random
      bringing them here. I wish he would take them to the Fort. There's no more
      work for the next hour, I suppose," and Hope, rather annoyed, began to
      pack his artistic traps.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a nearer view, Don Pedro proved to be a tall, lean, dry man, not unlike
      Dore's conception of Don Quixote. He must have had Indian blood in his
      veins, judging from his very dark eyes, his stiff, lank hair, worn
      somewhat long, and his high cheek-bones. Also, although he was arrayed in
      puritanic black, his barbaric love of color betrayed itself in a red tie
      and in a scarlet handkerchief which was twisted loosely round a soft
      slouch hat, It was the hat and the brilliant red of tie and handkerchief
      which had caught Mrs. Jasher's eye at so great a distance, and which had
      led her to pronounce the man a stranger, for Mrs. Jasher well knew that no
      Englishman would affect such vivid tints. All the same, in spite of this
      eccentricity, Don Pedro looked a thorough Castilian gentleman, and bowed
      gravely when presented to the ladies by Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jasher, Miss Kendal, permit me to present Don Pedro de Gayangos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am charmed," said the Peruvian, bowing, hat in hand, "and in turn,
      allow me, ladies, to introduce my daughter, Donna Inez de Gayangos."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie was also presented to the Don and to the young lady, after which
      Lucy and Mrs. Jasher, while not appearing to look, made a thorough
      examination of the lady with whom Random was in love. No doubt Donna Inez
      was making an examination on her own account, and with the cleverness of
      the sex the three women, while chatting affably, learned all that there
      was to be learned from the outward appearance of each other in three
      minutes. Miss Kendal could not deny but what Donna Inez was very
      beautiful, and frankly admitted&mdash;inwardly, of course&mdash;her own
      inferiority. She was merely pretty, whereas the Peruvian lady was truly
      handsome and quite majestic in appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet about Donna Inez there was the same indefinite barbaric look as
      characterized her father. Her face was lovely, dark and proud in
      expression, but there was an aloofness about it which puzzled the English
      girl. Donna Inez might have belonged to a race populating another planet
      of the solar system. She had large black, melting eyes, a straight Greek
      nose and perfect mouth, a well-rounded chin and magnificent hair, dark and
      glossy as the wing of the raven, which was arranged in the latest Parisian
      style of coiffure. Also, her gown&mdash;as the two women guessed in an
      instant&mdash;was from Paris. She was perfectly gloved and booted, and
      even if she betrayed somehow a barbaric taste for color in the dull ruddy
      hue of her dress, which was subdued with black braid, yet she looked quite
      a well-bred woman. All the same, her whole appearance gave an observant
      onlooker the idea that she would be more at home in a scanty robe and
      glittering with rudely wrought ornaments of gold. Perhaps Peru, where she
      came from, suggested the comparison, but Lucy's thoughts flew back to an
      account of the Virgins of the Sun, which the Professor had once described.
      It occurred to her, perhaps wrongly, that in Donna Inez she beheld one who
      in former days would have been the bride of some gorgeous Inca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear you will find England dull after the sunshine of Lima," said Lucy,
      having ended a swift examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Inez shivered a trifle and glanced around at the gray misty air
      through which the pale sunshine struggled with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly prefer the tropics to this," she said in musical English,
      "but my father has come down here on business, and until it is concluded
      we shall remain in this place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we must make things as bright as possible for you," said Mrs. Jasher
      cheerfully, and desperately anxious to learn more of the new-comers. "You
      must come to see me, Donna Inez&mdash;yonder is my cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, madame: you are very good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Don Pedro was talking to the two young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did arrive here earlier than I expected," he was remarking, "but I
      have to return to Lima shortly, and I wish to get my business with
      Professor Braddock finished as speedily as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry," said Lucy politely, "but my father is absent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when will he return, Miss Kendal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can scarcely say&mdash;in a week or a fortnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro made a gesture of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a pity, as I am so very pressed for time. Still, I must remain
      until the Professor returns. I am so anxious to hear if the mummy has been
      found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not found yet," said Hope quickly, "and never will be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro looked at him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be found," said he. "I have come all the way from Lima to obtain
      it. When you hear my story you will not be surprised at my desire to
      regain the mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Regain it?" echoed Hope and Random in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mummy was stolen from my father," he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE MANUSCRIPT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was certainly strange how constantly the subject of the missing mummy
      came uppermost. Since it had disappeared and since the man who had brought
      it to England was dead, it might have been thought that nothing more would
      be said about the matter. But Professor Braddock harped incessantly on his
      loss&mdash;which was perhaps natural&mdash;and Widow Anne also talked a
      great deal as to the possibility of the mummy, being found, as she hoped
      to learn by that means the name of the assassin who had strangled her poor
      boy. Now Don Pedro de Gayangos appeared with the strange information that
      the weird relic of Peruvian civilization had been stolen from his father.
      Apparently fate was not inclined to let the matter of the lost mummy drop,
      and was working round to a denouement, which would possibly include the
      solution of the mystery of Sidney Bolton's death. Yet, on the face of it,
      there appeared to be no chance of the truth becoming known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, when Don Pedro announced that the Mummy had formerly belonged
      to his father, every one was anxious to hear how it had been stolen. The
      Gayangos family were established in Lima, and the embalmed body of Inca
      Caxas had been purchased from a gentleman residing in Malta. How, then,
      had it crossed the water, and how had Don Pedro learned its whereabouts,
      only to arrive too late to secure his missing property? Mrs. Jasher was
      especially anxious to learn these things, and explained her reasons to
      Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, my dear," she said to the girl on the day after Don Pedro's
      arrival in Gartley, "if we learn the past of that horrid mummy, we may
      gain a clue to the person who desired possession of the nasty thing, and
      so may hunt down this terrible criminal. Once he is found, the mummy may
      be secured again, and should I be able to return it to your father, out of
      gratitude he would certainly marry me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to think that the assassin is a man," said Lucy dryly; "yet you
      forget that the person who talked to Sidney through the window of the
      Sailor's Rest was a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old woman," emphasized Mrs. Jasher briskly: "quite so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy contradicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eliza Flight did not say if the woman was old or young, but merely stated
      that she wore a dark dress and a dark shawl over her head. Still, this
      mysterious woman was connected in some way with the murder, else she would
      not have been speaking to Sidney."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't follow you, my dear. You talk as though poor Mr. Bolton expected
      to be murdered. For my part, I hold by the verdict of wilful murder
      against some person or persons unknown. The truth is to be found, if
      anywhere, in the past of the mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can discover nothing about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget what Don Pedro said, my dear," remarked Mrs. Jasher hastily,
      "that the mummy had been stolen from his father. Let us hear what he has
      to say and we may find a clue. I am anxious that the Professor should
      regain the green mummy for reasons which you know of. And now, my hear,
      can you come to dinner to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know." Miss Kendal hesitated. "Archie said that he would
      look in this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall ask Mr. Hope also, my love. Don Pedro is coming and his daughter
      likewise. Needless to say Sir Frank will follow the young lady. We shall
      be a party of six, and after dinner we must induce Don Pedro to relate the
      story of how the mummy was stolen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may not be inclined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think so," replied; Mrs. Jasher quickly. "He wants to get the mummy
      back again, and if we discuss the subject we may see some chance of
      securing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Don Pedro will not wish it to be restored to my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher shrugged her plump shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father and Don Pedro can arrange that themselves. All I desire is,
      that the mummy should be found. Undoubtedly it belongs by purchase to the
      Professor, but as it has been stolen, this Peruvian gentleman may claim
      it. Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall come and Archie also," assented Lucy, who was beginning to be
      interested in the matter. "The affair is somewhat romantic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Criminal, my dear, criminal," said Mrs. Jasher, rising to take her leave.
      "It is not a matter I care to mix myself up with. Still"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"you
      know, why I am doing so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had to take all this trouble to gain a husband," observed Lucy
      somewhat acidly, "I should remain single all my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were as lonely as I am," retorted the plump widow, "you would do
      your best to secure a man toy look after you. I should prefer a young and
      handsomer husband&mdash;such as Sir Frank Random, for instance but, as
      beggars cannot be choosers, I must content myself with old age, a famous
      scientist, and the chance of a possible title. Now mind, dear, to-night at
      seven&mdash;not a minute later," and she bustled away to prepare for the
      reception of her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Lucy that Mrs. Jasher was taking a great deal of trouble to
      become Mrs. Braddock, especially as the Professor's brother might live for
      many a long day yet, in which case the widow would not gain the title she
      coveted for years. However, the girl rather sympathized with Mrs. Jasher,
      who was a companionable soul, and fond of society. Circumstances condemned
      her to a somewhat lonely life in an isolated cottage in a rather dull
      neighborhood, so it was little to be wondered at that she should strive to
      move heaven and earth&mdash;as she was doing&mdash;in the hope of escaping
      from her solitude. Besides, although Miss Kendal did not wish to make a
      close companion of the widow, yet she did not dislike her, and, moreover,
      thought that she would make Professor Braddock a very presentable wife.
      Thinking thus, Lucy was quite willing to forward Mrs. Jasher's plans by
      inducing Don Pedro to tell all he knew about this missing mummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came about that six people assembled in the tiny pink parlor of
      Mrs. Jasher at the hour of seven o'clock. It required dexterous management
      to seat the whole company in the dining room, which was only a trifle
      larger than the parlor. However, Mrs. Jasher contrived to place them round
      her hospitable board in, a fairly comfortable fashion, and, once seated,
      the dinner was so good that no one felt the drawbacks of scanty elbow
      room. The widow, as hostess, was placed at the head of the table; Don
      Pedro, as the eldest of the men, at the foot; and Sir Frank, with Donna
      Inez, faced Archie and Lucy Kendal. Jane, who was well instructed in
      waiting by her mistress, attended to her duties admirably, acting both as
      footman and butler. Lucy, indeed, had offered Mrs. Jasher the services of
      Cockatoo to hand round the wine, but the widow with a pretty shudder had
      declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That dreadful creature with his yellow mop of hair gives me the shivers,"
      she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the isolation of the district, and the narrow limits of Mrs.
      Jasher's income, the meal was truly, admirable, being well cooked and well
      served, while the table was arrayed like an altar for the reception of the
      various dishes. Whatever Mrs. Jasher might be as an adventuress, she
      certainly proved herself to be a capital housekeeper, and Lucy foresaw
      that, if she did become Mrs. Braddock, the Professor would fare
      sumptuously, for the rest of his scientific life. When the meal was ended
      the widow produced a box of superfine cigars and another of cigarettes,
      after which she left the gentlemen to sip their wine, and took her two
      young friends to chatter chiffons in the tiny parlor. And it said much for
      Mrs. Jasher's methodical ways that, considering the limited space,
      everything went&mdash;as the saying goes&mdash;like clockwork. Likewise,
      the widow had proved herself a wonderful hostess, as she kept the ball of
      conversation rolling briskly and induced a spirit of fraternity, uncommon
      in an ordinary dinner party.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the meal Mrs. Jasher had kept off the subject of the mummy, which
      was the excuse for the entertainment; but when the gentlemen strolled into
      the parlor, feeling well fed and happy, she hinted at Don Pedro's quest.
      As the night was cold and the Peruvian gentleman came from the tropics, he
      was established in a well padded arm-chair close to the sea-coal fire, and
      with her own fair hands Mrs. Jasher gave him a cup of fragrant coffee,
      which was rendered still more agreeable to the palate by the introduction
      of a vanilla bean. With this and with a good cigar&mdash;for the ladies
      gave the gentlemen permission to smoke&mdash;Don Pedro felt very happy and
      easy, and complimented Mrs. Jasher warmly on her capability of making her
      fellow-creatures comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is altogether comfortable, madame," said Don Pedro, rising to make a
      courtly bow. In fact, so agreeable was the foreigner that Mrs. Jasher
      dreamed for one swift moment of throwing over the dry-as-dust scientist to
      become a Spanish lady of Lima.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You flatter me, Don Pedro," she said, waving a wholly unnecessary fan out
      of compliment to her guest's Spanish extraction. "Indeed, I am very glad
      that you are pleased with my poor little house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon, madame, but no house can be poor when it is a casket to contain
      such a jewel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" said Lucy somewhat satirically to the young men, while Mrs.
      Jasher blushed and bridled, "what Englishman could turn such a compliment?
      It reminds one of Georgian times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are more sober now than my fathers were then," said Hope, smiling,
      "and I am sure if Random thought for a few minutes he could produce
      something pretty. Go on, Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My brain is not equal to the strain after dinner," said Sir Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Donna Inez, she did not speak, but sat smiling quietly in her
      corner of the room, looking remarkably handsome. As a young girl Lucy was
      pretty, and Mrs. Jasher was a comely widow, but neither one had the
      majestic looks of the Spanish lady. She smiled, a veritable queen amidst
      the gim-crack ornaments of Mrs. Jasher's parlor, and Sir Frank, who was
      fathoms deep in love, could not keep his eyes off her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes the conversation was frivolous, quite the Shakespeare
      and musical glasses kind of speech. Then Mrs. Jasher, who had no idea that
      her good dinner should be wasted in charming nothings, introduced the
      subject of the mummy by a reference to Professor Braddock. It was
      characteristic of her cleverness that she did not address Don Pedro, but
      pointed her speech at Lucy Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do hope your father will return with that mummy," she observed, after a
      dexterous allusion to the late tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he has gone to look for it," replied Miss Kendal
      indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely he desired to get it back, after paying nearly one thousand
      pounds for it," said Mrs. Jasher, with well-feigned astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course; but he would scarcely look for it in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Professor Braddock gone to search for the mummy?" asked Don Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered Lucy. "He is visiting the British Museum to make some
      researches in the Egyptian department."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you expect him back, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say, Don Pedro. My father comes and goes as the whim takes him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spanish gentleman looked thoughtfully into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be glad to see the Professor when he returns," he said in his
      excellent, slow-sounding English. "My concern about this mummy is deep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," remarked Mrs. Jasher, shielding her fair cheek with the
      unnecessary fan, and venturing on a joke, "is the mummy a relative?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame," replied Don Pedro, gravely and unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this every one, very naturally, looked astonished&mdash;that is, all
      save Donna Inez, who still preserved her fixed smile. Mrs. Jasher took a
      mental note of the same, and decided that the young lady was not very
      intelligent. Meanwhile Don Pedro continued his speech after a glance round
      the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the blood of the royal Inca race in my veins," he said with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" murmured the widow to herself, "then that accounts for your love of
      color, which is so un-English;" then she raised her voice. "Tell us all
      about it, Don Pedro," she entreated; "we are usually so dull here that a
      romantic story excites us dreadfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know that it is very romantic," said Don Pedro with a polite
      smile, "and if you will not find it dull&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" said Archie, who was as anxious as Mrs. Jasher to hear what was
      to be said about the mummy. "Come, sir, we are all attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro bowed again, and again swept the circle with his deep-set eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Inca Caxas," he remarked, "was one of the decadent rulers of ancient
      Peru. At the Conquest by the Spaniards, Inca Atahuallpa was murdered by
      Pizarro, as you probably know. Inca Toparca succeeded him as a puppet
      king. He died also, and it was suspected that he was slain by a native
      chief called Challcuchima. Then Manco succeeded, and is looked upon by
      historians as the last Inca of Peru. But he was not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is news, indeed," said Random lazily. "And who was the last Inca?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who is now the green mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inca Caxas," ventured Lucy timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro looked at her sharply. "How do you come to know the name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mentioned it just now, but, before that, I heard my father mention
      it," said Lucy, who was surprised at the sharpness of his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where did the Professor learn the name?" asked Don Pedro anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say. But go on with the story," she continued, with the naive
      curiosity of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do," pleaded Mrs. Jasher, who was listening with all her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Peruvian meditated for a few minutes, then slipped his hand into the
      pocket of his coat and brought out a discolored parchment, scrawled and
      scribbled with odd-looking letters in purple ink somewhat faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever see this before?" he asked Lucy, "or any manuscript like
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she answered, bending forward to examine the parchment carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro again swept an inquiring eye round the circle, but everyone
      denied having seen the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" asked Sir Frank curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro restored the manuscript to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an account of the embalming of Inca Caxas, written by his son, who
      was my ancestor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are descended from this Inca?" said Mrs. Jasher eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. Had I my rights I should rule Peru. As it is, I am a poor gentleman
      with very little money. That," added Don Pedro with emphasis, "is why I
      wish to recover the mummy of my great ancestor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it then so valuable?" asked Archie suddenly. He was thinking of some
      reason why the mummy should have been stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, in itself it is of no great value, save to an archaeologist," was
      Don Pedro's reply; "but I had better tell you the story of how it was
      stolen from my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, go on," cried Mrs. Jasher. "This is most interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro plunged into his story without further preamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inca Caxas held his state amidst the solitudes of the Andes, away from
      the cruel men who had conquered his country. He died and was buried. This
      manuscript,"&mdash;he touched his pocket&mdash;"was written by his son,
      and details the ceremonies, the place of sepulchre, and also gives a list
      of the jewels with which the mummy was buried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jewels," murmured Hope under his breath. "I thought as much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The son of Inca Caxas married a Spanish lady and made peace with the
      Spaniards. He came to live at Cuzco, and brought with him, for some
      purpose which the manuscript does not disclose, the mummy of his father.
      But the manuscript was lost for years, and although my family&mdash;the De
      Gayangoses&mdash;became poor, no member of it knew that, concealed in the
      corpse of Inca Caxas, were two large emeralds of immense value. The mummy
      of our royal ancestor was treated as a sacred thing and venerated
      accordingly. Afterwards my family came to live at Lima, and I still dwell
      in the old house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how was the mummy stolen from you?" asked Random curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am coming to that," said Don Pedro, frowning at the interruption. "I
      was not in Lima at the time; but I had met the man who stole the precious
      mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he a Spaniard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered Don Pedro slowly, "he was an English sailor called Vasa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vasa is a Swedish name," observed Hope critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This man said that he was English, and certainly spoke like an
      Englishman, so far as I, a foreigner, can tell. At that time, when I was a
      young man, civil war raged in Peru. My father's house was sacked, and this
      Vasa, who had been received hospitably by my father when he was
      shipwrecked at Callao, stole the mummy, of Inca Caxas. My father died of
      grief and charged me to get the mummy back. When peace was restored to my
      unhappy country I tried to recover the venerated body of my ancestor. But
      all search proved vain, as Vasa had disappeared, and it was supposed that,
      for some reason, he had taken the embalmed body out of the country. It was
      when the mummy was lost that I unexpectedly came across the manuscript,
      which detailed the funeral ceremonies of Inca Caxas, and on learning about
      the two emeralds I was naturally more anxious than ever to discover the
      mummy and retrieve my fallen fortunes by means of the jewels. But, as I
      said, all search proved vain, and I afterward married, thinking to settle
      down on what fortune remained to me. I did live quietly in Lima for years
      until my wife died. Then with my daughter I came to Europe on a visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To search for the mummy?" questioned Archie eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. I had given up all hope of finding that. But chance placed a
      clue in my hands. At Genoa I came across a newspaper, which stated that a
      mummy in a green case&mdash;and a Peruvian mummy at that&mdash;was for
      sale at Malta. I immediately made inquiries, thinking that this was the
      long-lost body of Inca Caxas. But it so happened that I was too late, as
      already the mummy had been sold to Professor Braddock, and had been taken
      to England on board The Diver by Mr. Bolton. Chance, which had pointed out
      the whereabouts of the mummy, also brought me at Genoa into relations with
      Sir Frank Random"&mdash;Don Pedro bowed his head to the baronet&mdash;"and,
      as it appeared that he knew Professor Braddock, I thankfully accepted his
      offer to introduce me. Hence I am here, but only to hear that the mummy is
      again lost. That is all," and the Peruvian gentleman dramatically waved
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A strange story," said Archie, who was the first to speak, "and it
      certainly solves at least one part of the mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?" demanded Mrs. Jasher quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shows that the mummy was stolen on account of the emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, but that is impossible, sir," said Don Pedro, drawing up his
      lean figure. "No one but myself knew that the mummy held two emeralds in
      its dead hands, and I learned that only a few years ago from the
      manuscript which I had the honor of showing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is that objection assuredly," replied Hope with composure. "Yet I
      can hardly believe that any man would risk his neck to steal so remarkable
      a mummy, which he would have a difficulty in disposing of. But did this
      assassin know of the emeralds, he would venture much to gain them, since
      jewels can be disposed of with comparative ease, and cannot easily be
      traced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same," said Random, looking up, "I do not see how the assassin
      could have learned that the jewels were wrapped in the bandages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said Hope, glancing at De Gayangos, "perhaps there is more than
      one copy of this manuscript you speak of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to my knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sailor Vasa might have copied it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No." Don Pedro shook his head. "It is written in Latin, since a Spanish
      priest taught the son of Inca Caxas, who wrote it, that language. I do not
      think that Vasa knew Latin. Also, if Vasa had copied the manuscript, he
      would have stripped the mummy to procure the jewels. Now, in the newspaper
      advertisement it stated that the bandages of the mummy were intact, as
      also was the verdant case. No," said Don Pedro decisively, "I am quite of
      opinion that Vasa, and indeed everyone else, was ignorant of this
      manuscript."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me," suggested Mrs. Jasher, "that it would be best to find
      this sailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," remarked De Gayangos, "is impossible. It is twenty years since he
      disappeared with the mummy. Let us drop the subject until Professor
      Braddock returns to discuss it with me." And this was accordingly done.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. A DISCOVERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days went by, and Professor Braddock still remained absent in
      London, although an occasional letter to Lucy requested such and such an
      article from the museum to be forwarded, sometimes by post and on other
      occasions by Cockatoo, who traveled up to town especially. The Kanaka
      always returned with the news that his master was looking well, but
      brought no word of the Professor's return. Lucy was not surprised, as she
      was accustomed to Braddock's vagaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Don Pedro, comfortably established at the Warrior Inn, wandered
      about Gartley in his dignified way, taking very little interest in the
      village, but a great deal in the Pyramids. As the Professor was absent,
      Lucy could not ask him to dinner, but she did invite him and Donna Inez to
      afternoon tea. Don Pedro was anxious to peep into the museum, but Cockatoo
      absolutely refused to let him enter, saying that his master had forbidden
      anyone to view the collection during his absence. And in this refusal
      Cockatoo was supported by Miss Kendal, who had a wholesome dread of her
      step-father's rage, should he return and find that a stranger had been
      making free of his sacred apartments. The Peruvian gentleman expressed
      himself extremely disappointed, so much so, indeed, that Lucy fancied he
      believed Braddock had the green mummy hidden in the museum, in spite of
      the reported loss from the Sailor's Rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failing to get permission to range through the rooms of the Pyramids, Don
      Pedro paid occasional visits to Pierside and questioned the police
      regarding the Bolton murder. From Inspector Date he learned nothing of any
      importance, and indeed that officer expressed his belief that not until
      the Day of judgment would the truth become known. It then occurred to De
      Gayangos to explore the neighborhood of the Sailor's Rest, and to examine
      that public-house himself. He saw the famous window through which the
      mysterious woman had talked to the deceased, and noted that it looked
      across a stony, narrow path to the water's edge, wherefrom a rugged jetty
      ran out into the stream for some little distance. Nothing would have been
      easier, reflected Don Pedro, than for the assassin to enter by the window,
      and, having accomplished his deed, to leave in the same way, bearing the
      case containing the mummy. A few steps would carry the man and his burden
      to a waiting boat, and once the craft slipped into the mists on the river,
      all trace would be lost, as had truly happened. In this way the Peruvian
      gentleman believed the murder and the theft had been accomplished, but
      even supposing things had happened as he surmised, still, he was as far as
      ever from unraveling the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Don Pedro searched for his royal ancestor's corpse, and incidentally
      for the thief and murderer, his daughter was being wooed by Sir Frank
      Random. Heaven only knows what he saw in her&mdash;as Lucy observed to
      young Hope&mdash;for the girl had not a word to say for herself. She was
      undeniably handsome, and dressed with great taste, save for stray hints of
      barbaric delight in color, doubtless inherited from her Inca ancestors.
      All the same, she appeared to be devoid of small talk or great talk, or
      any talk whatsoever. She sat and smiled and looked like a handsome
      picture, but after her appearance had satisfied the eye, she left much to
      be desired. Yet Sir Frank approved of her stately quietness, and seemed
      anxious to make her his wife. Lucy, in spite of the fact that he had so
      speedily got over her refusal to marry him, was anxious that he should be
      happy with Donna Inez, whom he appeared to love, and afforded him every
      opportunity of meeting the lady, so that he might prosecute his wooing.
      All the same, she wondered that he should desire to marry an iceberg, and
      Donna Inez, with her silent tongue and cold smiles, was little else.
      However, as Frank Random was the chief party concerned in the love-making&mdash;for
      Donna Inez was merely passive&mdash;there was no more to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Hope came to dine at the Pyramids, and on these occasions Mrs.
      Jasher was present in her character of chaperon. As Miss Kendal was
      helping the widow to marry Professor Braddock, she in her turn did her
      best to speed Archie's wooing. Certainly the young couple were engaged and
      there was no understanding to be brought about. Nevertheless, Mrs. Jasher
      was a useful article of furniture to be in the room when they were
      together, for Gartley, like all English villages, was filled with
      scandalmongers, who would have talked, had Hope and Lucy not employed Mrs.
      Jasher as gooseberry. Sometimes Donna Inez came with the widow, while her
      father was hunting for the mummy in Pierside, and then Sir Frank Random
      would be sure to put in an appearance to woo his Dulcinea in admiring
      silence. Mrs. Jasher declared that the two must have made love by
      telepathy, for they rarely exchanged a word. But this was all the better,
      as Archie and Lucy chattered a great deal, and two pair of magpies&mdash;Mrs.
      Jasher declared&mdash;would have been too much for her nerves. She made a
      very good chaperon, as she allowed the young people to act as they
      pleased, only sanctioning the meetings by her elderly presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Mrs. Jasher was due to dinner, and Hope had already arrived.
      No one else was expected, as Don Pedro had taken his daughter to the
      theatre at Pierside and Sir Frank had gone to London in connection with
      his military duties. It was a bitterly cold night, and already a fall of
      snow had hinted that there was to be a real English Christmas of the
      genuine kind. Lucy had prepared an excellent dinner for three, and Archie
      had brought a set of new patience cards for Mrs. Jasher, who was fond of
      the game. While the widow played, the lovers hoped to make love
      undisturbed, and looked forward to a happy evening. But there was one
      drawback, for although the dinner hour was supposed to be eight o'clock,
      and it was now thirty minutes past, Mrs. Jasher had not arrived. Lucy was
      dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can be keeping her?" she asked Archie, to which that young gentleman
      replied that he did not know, and, what was more, he did not care. Miss
      Kendal very properly rebuked this sentiment. "You ought to care, Archie,
      for you know that if Mrs. Jasher does not come to dinner, you will have to
      go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I?" he inquired sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "People will talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them. I don't care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither do I, you stupid boy. But my father will care, and if people talk
      he will be very angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lucy," and Archie put his arm round her waist to say this, "I
      don't see why you should be afraid of the Professor. He is only your
      step-father, and you aren't so very fond of him as to mind what he says.
      Besides, we can marry soon, and then he can go hang."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't want him to go hang," she replied, laughing. "After all, the
      Professor has always been kind to me, and as a step-father has behaved
      very well, when he could easily have made himself disagreeable. Another
      thing is that he can be very bad tempered when he likes, and if I let
      people talk about us&mdash;which they will do if they get a chance&mdash;he
      will behave so coldly to me, that I shall have a disagreeable time. As we
      can't marry for ever so long, I don't want to be uncomfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can marry whenever you like," said Hope unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, with your income so unsettled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not unsettled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is. You will help that horrid spendthrift uncle of yours, and
      until he and his family are solvent I don't see how we can be sure of our
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are sure of it now, dearest. Uncle Simon has turned up trumps after
      all, and so have his investments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean exactly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that yesterday I received a letter from him saying that he was now
      rich, and would pay back all I had lent him. I went up to London to-day,
      and had an interview. The result of that is that I am some thousands to
      the good, that Uncle Simon is well off for the rest of his life and will
      require no more assistance, and that my three hundred a year is quite
      clear for ever and ever and ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we can marry," cried Miss Kendal with a gasp of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever you choose&mdash;next week if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In January then&mdash;just after Christmas. We'll go on a trip to Italy
      and return to take a flat in London. Oh, Archie, I am sorry I thought so
      badly of your uncle. He has behaved very well. And what a mercy it is that
      he will require no more assistance! You are sure he will not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he does, he won't get it," said Hope candidly. "While I was a bachelor
      I could assist him; but when I am married I must look after myself and my
      wife." He gave Lucy a hug. "It's all right now, dear, and Uncle Simon has
      behaved excellently&mdash;far better than I expected. We shall go to Italy
      for the honeymoon and need not hurry back until we&mdash;well, say until
      we quarrel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case we shall live in Italy for the rest of our lives," said Lucy
      with twinkling eyes; "but we must come back in a year and take a studio in
      Chelsea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not in Gartley? Remember, the Professor will be lonely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he won't. Mrs. Jasher, as I told you, intends to marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might not wish to marry her"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That doesn't matter," rejoined Lucy, with the cleverness of a woman. "She
      can manage to bring the marriage about. Besides, I want to break with the
      old life here, and begin quite a new one with you. When I am your wife and
      Mrs. Jasher is my step-father's, everything will be capitally arranged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope so," said Archie heartily, "for I want you all to myself and
      have no desire to share you with anyone else. But I say," he glanced at
      his watch; "it is getting towards nine o'clock, and I am desperately
      hungry. Can't we go to dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until Mrs. Jasher arrives," said Lucy primly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bother&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope, being quite exasperated with hunger, would have launched out into a
      speech condemning the widow's unpunctuality, when in the hall below the
      drawing-room was heard the sound of the door opening and closing. Without
      doubt this was Mrs. Jasher arriving at last, and Lucy ran out of the room
      and down the stairs to welcome her in her eagerness to get Archie seated
      at the dinner table. The young man lingered by the open door of the
      drawing-room, ready to welcome the widow, when he heard Lucy utter an
      exclamation of surprise and became aware that she was ascending the stairs
      along with Professor Braddock. At once he reflected there would be
      trouble, since he was in the house with Lucy, and lacked the necessary
      chaperon which Braddock's primitive Anglo-Saxon instincts insisted upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know you were returning to-night," Lucy was saying when she
      re-entered the drawing-room with her step-father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I arrived by the six o'clock train," explained the Professor, unwinding a
      large red scarf from his neck, and struggling out of his overcoat with the
      assistance of his daughter. "Ha, Hope, good evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been since?" asked Lucy, throwing the Professor's coat and
      wraps on to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With Mrs. Jasher," said Braddock, warming his plump hands at the fire.
      "So you must blame me that she is not here to preside at dinner as the
      chaperon of you young people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy and her lover glanced at one another in surprise. This light and airy
      tone was a new one for the Professor to take. Instead of being angry, he
      seemed to be unusually gay, and looked at them in quite a jocular manner
      for a dry-as-dust scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We waited dinner for her, father," ventured Lucy timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am ready to eat it," announced Braddock. "I am extremely hungry,
      my dear. I can't live on love, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Live on love?" Lucy stared, and Archie laughed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, you may smile and look astonished;" went on the Professor
      good-humoredly, "but science does not destroy the primeval instincts
      entirely. Lucy, my dear," he took her hand and patted it, "while in London
      and in lodgings, it was borne in upon me forcibly how lonely I was and how
      lonely I would be when you married our young friend yonder. I had intended
      to come down to-morrow, but to-night, such was my feeling of loneliness
      that I considered favorably your idea that I should find a second helpmate
      in Mrs. Jasher. I have always had a profound admiration for that lady, and
      so&mdash;on the spur of the moment, as I may say&mdash;I decided to come
      down this evening and propose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," Lucy clapped her hands, very well satisfied with the unexpected
      news, "and have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jasher," said the Professor gravely, "did me the honor to promise to
      become my wife this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will become your wife this evening?" said Archie, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock, with one of those odd twists of humor which were characteristic
      of him, became irascible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confound it, sir, don't I speak English," he snapped, with his eyes
      glaring rebuke. "She promised this evening to become Mrs. Braddock. We
      shall marry&mdash;so we have arranged&mdash;in the springtime, which is
      the natural pairing season for human beings as well as for birds. And I am
      glad to say that Mrs. Jasher takes a deep interest in archaeology."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, what is more, she is a splendid housekeeper," said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temporary anger of the Professor vanished. He drew his step-daughter
      towards him and kissed her on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe that I have to thank you for putting the idea into my head,"
      said he, "and also&mdash;if Mrs. Jasher is to be believed&mdash;for aiding
      her to see the mutual advantage it would be to both of us to marry. Ha,"
      he released Lucy and rubbed his hands, "let us go to dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad," said Miss Kendal heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I, so am I," replied Braddock, nodding. "As you very truly
      observed, my child, the house would have gone to rack and ruin without a
      woman to look after my interests. Well," he took the arms of the two young
      people, "I really think that we must have a bottle of champagne on the
      strength of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly the trio were seated at the table, and Braddock explained that
      Mrs. Jasher, being overcome by his proposal, had not been able to face the
      ordeal of congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she will come to-morrow," said he, as Cockatoo filled three glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I shall congratulate her to-night," said Lucy obstinately. "As
      soon as dinner is over, I shall go with Archie to her house, and tell her
      how pleased I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very cold for you to be out, Lucy dear," urged Archie anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I can wrap up warmly," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, the Professor made no objection to the excursion, although
      Hope quite expected such a stickler for etiquette to refuse permission to
      his step-daughter. But Braddock seemed rather pleased than otherwise. His
      proposal of marriage seemed to have put him into excellent humor, and he
      raised his glass with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I drink to your happiness, my dear Lucy, and to that of Mrs. Jasher's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I drink to Archie's and to yours, father," she replied. "I am glad
      that you will not be lonely when we are married. Archie and I wish to
      become one in January."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Hope, finishing his champagne, "my income is now all right, as
      my uncle has paid up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, very good. I make no objection," said Braddock placidly. "I
      will give you a handsome wedding present, Lucy, for you may have heard
      that my future wife has money left to her by her brother, who was lately a
      merchant in Pekin. She is heart and hand with me in our proposed
      expedition to Egypt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you go there for the honeymoon, sir?" asked Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly for the honeymoon, since we are to be married in spring, and
      my expedition to the tomb of Queen Tahoser cannot start until the late
      autumn. But Mrs. Braddock will come with me. That is only just, since it
      will be her money which will furnish the sinews of war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, everything is arranged very well," said Lucy. "I marry Archie; you,
      father, make Mrs. Jasher your wife; and I suspect Sir Frank will marry
      Donna Inez."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" said Braddock with a start, "the daughter of De Gayangos, who has
      come here for the missing mummy. Mrs. Jasher told me somewhat of that, my
      dear. But I shall see Don Pedro myself to-morrow. Meanwhile, let us eat
      and drink. I must go down to the museum, and you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall go to congratulate Mrs. Jasher," said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was arranged, and shortly Professor Braddock retired into his
      sanctum along with the devoted Cockatoo, who displayed lively joy on
      beholding his master once more. Lucy, after being carefully wrapped up by
      Archie, set out with that young man to congratulate the bride-elect. It
      was just half-past nine when they started out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was frosty and the stars twinkled like jewels in a cloudless sky
      of dark blue. The moon shone with hard brilliance on the ground, which was
      powdered with a light fall of snow. As the young people walked briskly
      through the village, their footsteps rang on the frosty earth and they
      scrunched the snow in their quick tread. The Warrior Inn was still open,
      as it was not late, and lights shone from the windows of the various
      cottages. When the two, following the road through the marshes, emerged
      from the village, they saw the great mass of the Fort bulking blackly
      against the clear sky, the glittering stream of the Thames, and the
      marshes outlined in delicate white. The fairy world of snow and moonlight
      appealed to Archie's artistic sense, and Lucy approving of the same, they
      did not hurry to arrive at their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      But shortly they saw the squarely fenced acre of ground near the
      embankment, wherein Mrs. Jasher's humble abode was placed. Light shone
      through the pink curtains of the drawing-room, showing that the widow had
      not yet retired. In a few minutes the lovers were at the gate and promptly
      entered. It was then that one of those odd things happened which would
      argue that some people are possessed of a sixth sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie closed the gate after him, and, glancing right and left, walked up
      the snowy path with Lucy. To the right was a leafless arbor, also powdered
      with snow, and against the white bulked a dark form something like a
      coffin. Hope out of curiosity went up to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce is this?" he asked himself; then raised his voice in loud
      surprise. "Lucy! Lucy! come here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" she asked, running up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look"&mdash;he pointed to the oddly shaped case&mdash;"the green mummy!"
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. MORE MYSTERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Neither Lucy nor Archie Hope had ever seen the mummy, but they knew the
      appearance which it would present, as Professor Braddock, with the
      enthusiasm of an archaeologist, had often described the same to them. It
      appeared, according to Braddock, that on purchasing the precious corpse in
      Malta, his dead assistant had written home a full description of the
      treasure trove. Consequently, being advised beforehand, Hope had no
      difficulty in recognizing the oddly shaped case, which was made somewhat
      in the Egyptian form. On the impulse of the moment he had proclaimed this
      to be the long-lost mummy, and when a closer examination by the light of a
      lucifer match revealed the green hue of the coffin wood, he knew that he
      was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was the mummy in its ancient case doing in Mrs. Jasher's arbor?
      That was the mute question which the two young people asked themselves and
      each other, as they stood in the chilly moonlight, staring at the
      grotesque thing. The mummy had disappeared from the Sailor's Rest at
      Pierside some weeks ago, and now unexpectedly appeared in a lonely garden,
      surrounded by marshes. How it had been brought there, or why it should
      have been brought there, or who had brought it to such an unlikely place,
      were questions hard to answer. However, the most obvious thing to do was
      to question Mrs. Jasher, since the uncanny object was lying within a
      stone-throw of her home. Lucy, after a rapid word or two, went to ring the
      bell, and summon the lady, while Archie stood by the arbor, wondering how
      the mummy came to be there. In the same way George III had wondered how
      the apples got into the dumplings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far and wide spread the marshes, flatly towards the shore of the river on
      one side, but on the other sloping up to Gartley village, which twinkled
      with many lights on the rising ground. Some distance away the Fort rose
      black and menacing in the moonlight, and the mighty stream of the Thames
      glittered like polished steel as it flowed seaward. As there were only a
      few leafless trees dotted about the marshy ground, and as that same
      ground, lightly sprinkled with powdery snow, revealed every moving object
      for quite a mile or so, Hope could not conceive how the mummy case, which
      seemed heavy, could have been brought into the silent garden without its
      bearers being seen. It was not late, and soldiers were still returning
      through Gartley to the Fort. Then, again, some noise must have been caused
      by so bulky an object being thrust through the narrow wicket, and Mrs.
      Jasher, inhabiting a wooden house, which was a very sea-shell for sound,
      might have heard footsteps and voices. If those who had brought the mummy
      here&mdash;and there was more than one from the size of the case&mdash;could
      be discovered, then the mystery of Sidney Bolton's death would be solved
      very speedily. It was at this moment of his reflections that Lucy returned
      to the arbor, leading Mrs. Jasher, who was attired in a tea-gown and who
      looked bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you talking about, my dear?" she said, as Lucy led her towards
      the arbor. "I declare I was ever so much astonished, when Jane told me
      that you wished to speak to me. I was just writing a letter to the lawyer
      who has my poor brother's property in hand, announcing my engagement to
      the Professor. Mr. Hope? You here also. Well, I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy grew impatient at all this babble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you not hear what I said, Mrs. Jasher?" she cried irritably. "Can't
      you use your eyes? Look! The green mummy is in your arbor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The&mdash;green&mdash;mummy&mdash;in&mdash;my&mdash;arbor," repeated Mrs.
      Jasher, like a child learning words of one syllable, and staring at the
      black object before which the three were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you see," said Archie abruptly. "How did it come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke harshly. Of course, it was absurd to accuse Mrs. Jasher of
      knowing anything about the matter, since she had been writing letters.
      Still, the fact remained that a mummy, which had been thieved from a
      murdered man, was in her arbor, and naturally she was called upon to
      explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some suspicion in his tone struck the little woman, and she turned on him
      with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did it come here?" she repeated. "Now, how can I tell, you silly boy.
      I have been writing to my lawyer about my engagement to Mr. Braddock. I
      daresay he has told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," chimed in Miss Kendal, "and we came here to congratulate you, only
      to find the mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the horrid thing?" Mrs. Jasher stared with all her eyes, and
      timidly touched the hard green-stained wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the case&mdash;the mummy is inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought that the Professor opened the case to find the body of poor
      Sidney Bolton," argued Mrs. Jasher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a packing case in which this"&mdash;Archie struck the old-world
      coffin&mdash;"was stored. But this is the corpse of Inca Caxas, about
      which Don Pedro told us the other night. How does it come to be hidden in
      your garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hidden." Mrs. Jasher repeated the word with a laugh. "There is not much
      hiding about it. Why, every one can see it from the path."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And from the door of your house," remarked Hope significantly. "Did you
      not see it when you took leave of Braddock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," snapped the widow. "If I had I should certainly have come to look.
      Also Professor Braddock, who is so anxious to recover it, would not have
      allowed it to remain here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the case was not here when the Professor left you to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! He left me at eight o'clock to go home to dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did he arrive here?" questioned Hope quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At seven. I am sure of the time, for I was just sitting down to my
      supper. He was here an hour. But he said nothing, when he entered, of any
      mummy being in the arbor; nor when he left me at the door and I came to
      say good-bye to him&mdash;did either of us see this object. To be sure,"
      added Mrs. Jasher meditatively, "we did not look particularly in the
      direction of this arbor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely see how any one entering or leaving the garden could fail to
      see it, especially as the snow reflects the moonlight so brightly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher shivered, and taking the skirt of her tea-gown, flung it over
      her carefully attired head,
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very cold," she remarked irritably. "Don't you think we had better
      return to the house, and talk there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said Archie grimly, "and leave the mummy to be carried away as
      mysteriously as it has been brought. No, Mrs. Jasher. That mummy
      represents one thousand pounds of my money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understood that the Professor bought it himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he did, but I supplied the purchase money. Therefore I do not intend
      that this should be lost sight of again. Lucy, my dear, you run home again
      and tell your father what we have found. He had better bring men, to take
      it to his museum. When it is there, Mrs. Jasher can then explain how it
      came to be in her garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word Lucy set off, walking quickly, anxious to fulfill her
      mission and gladden the heart of her step-father with the amazing news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie and Mrs. Jasher were left alone, and the former lighted a
      cigarette, while he tapped the mummy case, and examined it as closely as
      the pale gleam of the moonlight permitted. Mrs. Jasher made no move to
      enter the house, much as she had complained of the cold. But perhaps she
      found the flimsy skirt of the tea-gown sufficient protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me, Mr. Hope," said she very tartly, "that you suspect my
      having a hand in this," and she tapped the mummy coffin also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," observed Hope very politely, "but I suspect nothing, because
      I have no grounds upon which to base my suspicions. But certainly it is
      odd that this missing mummy should be found in your garden. You will admit
      that much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admit nothing of the sort," she rejoined coolly. "Only myself and Jane
      live in the cottage, and you don't expect that two delicate women could
      move this huge thing." She tapped the case again. "Moreover, had I found
      the mummy I should have taken it to the Pyramids at once, so as to give
      Professor Braddock some pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will certainly be an acceptable wedding present," said Archie
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," said Mrs. Jasher in her turn, "but I have nothing to do with
      it as a present or otherwise. How the thing came into my arbor I really
      cannot say. As I told you, Professor Braddock made no remark about it when
      he came; and when he left, although I was at the door, I did not notice
      anything in this arbor. Indeed I cannot say if I ever looked in this
      direction."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie mused and glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Professor told Lucy that he came by the six train: you say that he
      was here at seven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and he left at eight. What is the time now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten o'clock, or a few minutes after. Therefore, since neither you nor
      Braddock saw the mummy, I take it that the case was brought here by some
      unknown people between eight o'clock and a quarter to ten, about which
      time I arrived here with Lucy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You put the matter very clearly," she observed dryly. "You have mistaken
      your vocation, Mr. Hope, and should have been a criminal lawyer. I should
      turn detective were I you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Archie with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might ascertain my movements on the night when the crime was
      committed," snapped the little widow. "A woman muffled in a shawl, in much
      the same way as my head is now muffled in my skirt, talked to Bolton
      through the bedroom window of the Sailor's Rest, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope expostulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lady, how you run on! I assure you that I would as soon suspect
      Lucy as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said the widow very dryly and very tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I merely wish to point out," went on Archie in a conciliatory tone,
      "that, as the mummy in its case&mdash;as appears probable&mdash;was
      brought into your garden between the hours of eight and ten, less fifteen
      minutes, that you may have heard the voices or footsteps of those who
      carried it here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard nothing," said Mrs. Jasher, turning towards the path. "I had my
      supper, and played a game or two of patience, and then wrote letters, as I
      told you before. And I am not going to stand in the cold, answering silly
      questions, Mr. Hope. If you wish to talk you must come inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope shook his head and lighted a fresh cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stand guard over this mummy until its rightful owner comes," said he
      determinedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho!" rejoined Mrs. Jasher scornfully: she was now at the door. "I
      understood that you bought the mummy and therefore were its owner. Well, I
      only hope you'll find those emeralds Don Pedro talked about," and with a
      light laugh she entered the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie looked after her in a puzzled way. There was no reason to suspect
      Mrs. Jasher, so far as he saw, even though a woman had been seen talking
      to Bolton on the night of the crime. And yet, why should the widow refer
      to the emeralds, which were of such immense value, according to Don Pedro?
      Hope glanced at the case and shook the primitive coffin, anxious for the
      moment to open it and ascertain if the jewels were still clutched grimly
      in the mummy's dead hands. But the coffin was fastened tightly down with
      wooden pegs, and could only be opened with extreme care and difficulty.
      Also, as Hope reflected, even did he manage to open this receptacle of the
      dead, he still could not ascertain if the emeralds were safe, since they
      would be hidden under innumerable swathings of green-dyed llama wool. He
      therefore let the matter rest there, and, staring at the river, wondered
      how the mummy had been brought to the garden in the marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope recollected that experts had decided the mode in which the mummy had
      been removed from the Pierside public-house. It had been passed through
      the window, according to Inspector Date and others, and, when taken across
      the narrow path which bordered the river, had been placed in a waiting
      boat. After that it had vanished until it had re-appeared in this arbor.
      But if taken by water once, it could have been taken by water again. There
      was a rude jetty behind the embankment, which Hope could easily see from
      where he stood. In all probability the mummy had been landed there and
      carried to the garden, while Mrs. Jasher was busy with her supper and her
      game of cards and her letters. Also, the path from the shore to the house
      was very lonely, and if any care had been exercised, which was probable,
      no one from the Fort road or from the village street could have seen the
      stealthy conspirators bringing their weird burden. So far Hope felt that
      he could argue excellently. But who had brought the mummy to the garden
      and why had it been brought there? These questions he could not answer so
      easily, and indeed not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus meditating, he heard, far away in the frosty air, a puffing and
      blowing and panting like an impatient motor-car. Before he could guess
      what this was, Braddock appeared, simply racing along the marshy causeway,
      followed closely by Cockatoo, and at some distance away by Lucy. The
      little scientist rushed through the gate, which he flung open with a noise
      fit to wake the dead, and lunged forward, to fall with outstretched arms
      upon the green case. There he remained, still puffing and blowing, and
      looked as though he were hugging a huge green beetle. Cockatoo, who, being
      lean and hard, kept his breath more easily, stood respectfully by, waiting
      for his master to give orders, and Lucy came in quietly by the gate,
      smiling at her father's enthusiasm. At the same moment Mrs. Jasher, well
      wrapped up in a coat of sables, emerged from the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard you coming, Professor," she called out, hurrying down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think the whole Fort heard the Professor coming," said Hope,
      glancing at the dark mass. "The soldiers must think it is an invasion."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Braddock paid no heed to this jocularity, or even to Mrs. Jasher, to
      whom he had been so lately engaged. All his soul was in the mummy case,
      and as soon as he recovered his breath, he loudly proclaimed his joy at
      this miraculous recovery of the precious article.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine! mine!" he roared, and his words ran violently through the frosty
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be calm, sir," advised Hope&mdash;"be calm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Calm! calm!" bellowed Braddock, struggling to a standing position. "Oh,
      confound you, sir, how can I be calm when I find what I have lost? You
      have a mean, groveling soul, Hope, not the soaring spirit of a collector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need to be rude to Archie, father," corrected Lucy sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rude! Rude! I am never rude. But this mummy." Braddock peered closely at
      it and rapped the wood to assure himself it was no phantom. "Yes! it is my
      mummy, the mummy of Inca Caxas. Now I shall learn how the Peruvians
      embalmed their royal dead. Mine! mine! mine!" He crooned like a mother
      over a child, caressing the coffin; then suddenly drew himself upright and
      fixed Mrs. Jasher with an indignant eye. "So it was you, madam, who stole
      my mummy," he declared venomously, "and I thought of making you my wife.
      Oh, what an escape I have had. Shame, woman, shame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher stared, then her face grew redder than the rouge on her
      cheeks, and she stamped furiously in the neat Louis Quinze slippers in
      which she had in judiciously come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you say what you have said?" she cried, her voice shrill and
      hard with anger. "Mr. Hope has been saying the same thing. Are you both
      mad? I never set eyes on the horrid thing in my life. And only to-night
      you told me that you loved&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, I said many foolish things, I don't doubt, madam. But that is
      not the question. My mummy! my mummy!" he rapped the wood furiously&mdash;"how
      does my mummy come to be here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Mrs. Jasher, still furious, "and I don't care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't care: don't care, when I look forward to your helping me in my
      lifework! As my wife&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never be your wife," cried the widow, stamping again. "I wouldn't
      be your wife for a thousand or a million pounds. Marry your mummy, you
      horrid, red-faced, crabbed little&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! hush!" whispered Lucy, taking the angry woman round the waist, "you
      must make allowances for my father. He is so excited over his good fortune
      that he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not make allowance," interrupted Mrs. Jasher angrily. "He
      practically accuses me of stealing the mummy. If I did that, I must have
      murdered poor Sidney Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," cried the Professor, wiping his red face. "I never hinted at
      such a thing. But the mummy is in your garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of that? I don't know how it came there. Mr. Hope, surely you do not
      support Professor Braddock in his preposterous accusation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bring no accusation," stuttered the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither do I, Mrs. Jasher. You are excited now. Go in and sleep, and
      to-morrow you will talk reasonably." This brilliant speech was from Hope,
      and wrought Mrs. Jasher into a royal rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she gasped, "he asks me to be calm, as it I wasn't the very
      calmest person here. I declare: oh, I shall be ill! Lucy," she seized the
      girl's hand and dragged her towards the cottage, "come in and give me red
      lavender. I shall be in bed for days and days and days. Oh, what brutes
      men can be! But listen, you two horrors," she indicated Braddock and Hope,
      as she pushed open the door, "if you dare to say a word against me, I'll
      have an action for libel against you. Oh, dear me, how very ill I feel!
      Lucy, darling, help me, oh, help me, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!"
      She flopped down on the threshold of her home with a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Archie! Archie! She's fainted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope rushed forward, and raised the stout little woman in his arms. Jane,
      attracted by the clamor, appeared on the scene, and between the three of
      them they managed to get Mrs. Jasher placed on the sofa of the pink
      drawing-room. She certainly was in a dead faint, so Hope left her to the
      administrations of Lucy and the servant, and walked out again into the
      garden, closing the cottage door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the heartless Professor quite oblivious to Mrs. Jasher's
      sufferings, so taken up was he with the newly found mummy. Cockatoo had
      been sent for a hand-cart, and while he was absent Braddock expatiated on
      the perfections of this relic of Peruvian civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you sell it to Don Pedro?" asked Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After I have done with it, not before," snapped Braddock, hovering round
      his treasure. "I shall want a percentage on my bargain also."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie thought privately that if Braddock unswathed the mummy, he would
      find the emeralds and would probably stick to them, so that his expedition
      to Egypt might be financed. It that case Don Pedro would no longer wish to
      buy the corpse of his ancestor. But while he debated as to the
      advisability of telling the Professor of the existence of the emeralds,
      Cockatoo returned with the hand-cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have lost Mrs. Jasher," said Hope, while he, assisted the Professor
      to hoist the mummy on to the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind! never mind!" Braddock patted the coffin. "I have found
      something much more to my mind: something ever so much better. Ha! ha!"

      CHAPTER XIV. THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In spite of newspapers and letters and tape-machines and telegrams and
      such like aids to the speedy diffusion of news, the same travels quicker
      in villages than in cities. Word of mouth can spread gossip with marvelous
      rapidity in sparsely inhabited communities, since it is obvious that in
      such places every person knows the other&mdash;as the saying goes&mdash;inside
      out. In every English village walls have ears and windows have eyes, so
      that every cottage is a hot-bed of scandal, and what is known to one is,
      within the hour, known to the others. Even the Sphinx could not have
      preserved her secret long in such a locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gartley could keep up its reputation in this respect along with the best,
      therefore it was little to be wondered at, that early next morning every
      one knew that Professor Braddock had found his long-lost mummy in Mrs.
      Jasher's garden, and had removed the same to the Pyramids without
      unnecessary delay. It was not particularly late when the hand-cart, with
      its uncanny burden, had passed along the sole street of the place, and
      several men had emerged from the Warrior Inn ostensibly to offer help, but
      really to know what the eccentric master of the great house was doing.
      Braddock brusquely rejected these offers; but the oddly shaped mummy case,
      stained green, having been seen, it needed little wit for those who had
      caught a sight of it to put two and two together, especially as the weird
      object had been described at the inquest and had been talked over ever
      since in every cottage. And as the cart had been seen coming out of the
      widow's garden, it naturally occurred to the villagers that Mrs. Jasher
      had been concealing the mummy. Shortly the rumor spread that she had also
      murdered Bolton, for unless she had done so, she certainly&mdash;according
      to village logic&mdash;could not have been possessed of the spoil.
      Finally, as Mrs. Jasher's doors and windows were small and the mummy was
      rather bulky, it was natural to presume that she had hidden it in the
      garden. Report said she had buried it and had dug it up just in time to be
      pounced upon by its rightful owner. From which it can be seen that gossip
      is not invariably accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      However this may be, the news of Professor Braddock's good fortune shortly
      came to Don Pedro's ears through the medium of the landlady. As she
      revealed what she had heard in the morning, the Peruvian gentleman was
      spared a sleepless night. But as soon as he learned the truth&mdash;which
      was surprising enough in its unexpectedness&mdash;he hastily finished his
      breakfast and hurried to the Pyramids. As yet he had not intended to see
      Braddock so promptly, or at least not until he had made further inquiries
      at Pierside, but the news that Braddock possessed the royal ancestor of
      the De Gayangoses brought him immediately into the museum. He greeted the
      Professor in his usual grave and dignified manner, and no one would have
      guessed from his inherent calmness that the unexpected news of Braddock's
      arrival, and the still more unexpected information about the green mummy,
      had surprised him beyond measure. Being somewhat superstitious, it also
      occurred to Don Pedro that the coincidence meant good fortune to him in
      the recovery of his long-lost ancestor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock, already knowing a great deal about Don Pedro from Lucy and
      Archie Hope, was only too pleased to see the Peruvian, hoping to find in
      him a kindred spirit. As yet the Professor was not aware of the contents
      of the ancient Latin manuscript, which revealed the fact of the hidden
      emeralds, since Hope had decided to leave it to the Peruvian to impart the
      information. Archie knew very well that Don Pedro&mdash;as he had plainly
      stated&mdash;wished to purchase the mummy, and it was only right that
      Braddock should know what he was selling. But Hope forgot one important
      fact perhaps from the careless way in which Don Pedro had told his story&mdash;namely,
      that the Professor in a second degree was a receiver of stolen goods.
      Therefore it was more than probable that the Peruvian would claim the
      mummy as his own property. Still, in that event he would have to prove his
      claim, and that would not be easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plump little professor had not yet unsealed the case, and when Don
      Pedro entered, he was standing before it rubbing his fat hands, with a
      gloating expression in his face. However, as Cockatoo had brought in the
      Peruvian's card, Braddock expected his visitor and wheeled to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, sir?" said he, extending his hand. "I am glad to see you, as
      I hear that you know all about this mummy of Inca Caxas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I do," answered De Gayangos, sitting down in the chair which his
      host pushed forward. "But may I ask who told you that this mummy was that
      of the last Inca?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock pinched his plump chin and replied readily, enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, Don Pedro. I wished to learn the difference in embalming
      between the Egyptians and the ancient Peruvians, and looked about for a
      South American corpse. Unexpectedly I saw in several European newspapers
      and in two English journals that a green Peruvian mummy was for sale at
      Malta for one thousand pounds. I sent my assistant, Sidney Bolton, to buy
      it, and he managed to get it, coffin and all, for nine hundred. While in
      Malta, and before he started back in The Diver with the mummy, he wrote me
      an account of the transaction. The seller&mdash;who was the son of a
      Maltese collector&mdash;told Bolton that his father had picked up the
      mummy in Paris some twenty and more years ago. It came from Lima some
      thirty years back, I believe, and, according to the collector in Paris,
      was the corpse of Inca Caxas. That is the whole story."
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was there a Latin manuscript delivered along with the mummy?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock's eyes opened widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. The mummy came thirty years ago from Lima to Paris. It passed
      twenty years back into the possession of the Maltese collector, and his
      son sold it to me a few months ago. I never heard of any manuscript."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Mr. Hope did not repeat to you what I told him the other night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor sat down and his mouth grew obstinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hope related some story you told him and others about this mummy
      having been stolen from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From my father," corrected the unsmiling Peruvian; keeping a careful eye
      on his host; "that is really the case. Inca Caxas is, or was, my ancestor,
      and this manuscript"&mdash;Don Pedro produced the same from his inner
      pocket&mdash;"details the funeral ceremonies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very interesting; most interesting," fussed Braddock, stretching out his
      hand. "May I see it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You read Latin," observed Don Pedro, surrendering the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," he said simply, "every well-educated man reads Latin, or
      should do so. Wait, sir, until I glance through this document."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment," said Don Pedro, as the Professor began to literally devour
      the discolored page. "You know from Hope, I have no doubt, how I chance
      upon my own property in Europe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock, still with his eyes on the manuscript, mumbled
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own property. Quite so: quite so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You admit that. Then you will no doubt restore the mummy to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the drift of Don Pedro's observations entirely reached the
      understanding of the scientist, and he dropped the document he was reading
      to leap to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Restore the mummy to you!" he gasped. "Why, it is mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," said the Peruvian, still gravely but very decisively, "you
      admitted that it belonged to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock's face deepened to a fine purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know what I was saying," he protested. "How could I say it was
      your property when I have bought it for nine hundred pounds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was stolen from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That has got to be proved," said Braddock caustically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro rose, looking more like, Don Quixote than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the honor to give you my word and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes. That is all right. I cast no imputation on your honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think not," said the other coldly but strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same, you can scarcely expect me to part with so valuable an
      object," Braddock waved his hand towards the case, "without strict inquiry
      into the circumstances. And again, sir, even if you succeed in proving
      your ownership, I am not inclined to restore the mummy to you for
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is stolen property you are keeping from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing about that: I have only your bare word that it is so, Don
      Pedro. All I know is that I paid nine hundred pounds for the mummy and
      that it cost the best part of another hundred to bring it to England. What
      I have, I keep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like your country," said the Peruvian sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely," replied the Professor suavely. "Every Englishman has a
      bull-dog tenacity of purpose. Brag is a good dog, Don Pedro, but Holdfast
      is a better one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I understand," said the Peruvian, stretching out his hand to pick up
      the fallen manuscript, "that you will keep the mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Braddock coolly, "since I have paid for it. Also, I
      shall keep the jewels, which the manuscript tells me&mdash;from the glance
      I obtained of it&mdash;were buried with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sole jewels buried are two large emeralds which the mummy holds in
      its hands," explained Don Pedro, restoring the manuscript to his pocket,
      "and I wish for them so that I may get money to restore the fortunes of my
      family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! no!" said Braddock forcibly. "I have bought the mummy and the
      jewels with it. They will sell to supply me with money to fit out my
      expedition to the tomb of Queen Tahoser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall dispute your claim," cried De Gayangos, losing his calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock waved his hand with supreme content.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can give you the address of my lawyers," he retorted; "any steps you
      choose to take will only result in loss, and from what you hint I should
      not think that you had much money to spend on litigation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro bit his lip, and saw that it was indeed a more difficult task
      than he had anticipated to make Braddock yield up his prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were in Lima," he muttered, speaking Spanish in his excitement,
      "you would then learn that I speak truly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not doubt your truth," answered the Professor in the same language.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Gayangos wheeled and faced his host, much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak my tongue, senor?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been in Spain, and I have been in Peru," he answered dryly,
      "therefore I know classical Spanish and its colonial dialects. As to being
      in Lima, I was there, and I do not wish to go there again, as I had quite
      enough of those uncivilized parts thirty years ago, when the country was
      much disturbed after your civil war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were in Lima thirty years ago," echoed Don Pedro; "then you were
      there when Vasa stole this mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know who stole it, or even if it was stolen," said the Professor
      obstinately, "and I don't know the name of Vasa. Ah! now I remember. Young
      Hope did say something about the Swedish sailor who you said stole the
      mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vasa did, and brought it to Europe to sell&mdash;probably to that man in
      Paris, who afterwards sold it to your Malteses collector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt," rejoined Braddock calmly; "but what has all this to do with
      me, Don Pedro?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want my mummy," raged the other, and looked dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you won't get it," retorted Braddock, adopting a pugnacious attitude
      and quite composed. "This mummy has caused one death, Don Pedro, and from
      your looks I should think you would like it to cause another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you not be honest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll knock your head off if you bring my honesty into question," cried
      the Professor, standing on tip-toe like a bantam. "The best thing to do
      will be to take the matter into court. Then the law can decide, and I have
      little doubt but what it will decide in my favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman and the Peruvian glared at one another, and Cockatoo, who
      was crouching on the floor, glanced from one angry face to another. He
      guessed that the white men were quarreling and perhaps would come to
      blows. It was at this moment that a knock came to the door, and a minute
      later Archie entered. Braddock glanced at him, and took a sudden
      resolution as he stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope, you are just in time," he declared. "Don Pedro states that the
      mummy belongs to him, and I assert that I have bought it. We shall make
      you umpire. He wants it: I want it. What is to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mummy is my own flesh and blood, Mr. Hope," said Don Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precious little of either about it," said Braddock contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie twisted a chair round and straddled his long legs across it, with
      his arms resting on its back. His quick brain had rapidly comprehended the
      situation, and, being acquainted with both sides of the question, it was
      not difficult to come to a decision. If it was hard that Don Pedro should
      lose his ancestor's mummy, it was equally hard that Braddock&mdash;or
      rather himself&mdash;should lose the purchase money, seeing that it had
      been paid in good faith to the seller in Malta for a presumably
      righteously acquired object. On these premises the young Solon proceeded
      to deliver judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said he judiciously, "that Don Pedro had the mummy stolen
      from him thirty years ago, and that you, Professor, bought it under the
      impression that the Maltese owner had a right to possess it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," snapped Braddock, "and I daresay the Maltese owner thought so too,
      since he bought it from that collector in Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if Vasa sold it to the man in Paris," said he calmly, "he certainly
      would not tell the purchaser that he had looted the mummy in Lima, and the
      poor man would not know that he was receiving stolen goods. Is that right,
      Don Pedro?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said the Peruvian, who had recovered his temper and his
      gravity; "but I declare solemnly that the mummy was stolen from my father
      and should belong to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one disputes that," said Archie cheerfully; "but it ought to belong to
      the Professor also, since he has bought it. Now, as it can't possibly
      belong to two people, we must split the difference. You, Professor, must
      sell back the mummy to Don Pedro for the price you paid for it, and then,
      Don Pedro, you must recompense Professor Braddock for his loss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not much money," said Don Pedro gravely; "still, I am willing to
      do as you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that I am," protested Braddock noisily. "There are the two
      emeralds which are of immense value, as Don Pedro says, and they belong to
      me, since the mummy is my property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Professor," said Archie solemnly, "you must do right, even if you lose by
      it. I believe the story of Senor De Gayangos; and the mummy with its
      jewels belongs to him. Besides, you only wish to see the way in which the
      Inca race embalmed their dead. Well, then, unpack the mummy here in the
      presence of Don Pedro. When you have satisfied your curiosity, and when
      Senor De Gayangos signs a check for one thousand pounds, he can take away
      the corpse. You have had so much trouble over it, that I wonder your are
      not anxious to see the last of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the emeralds would sell for much money and would defray the expenses
      of my expedition into Egypt to search for that Queen's tomb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understood from Lucy that Mrs. Jasher intended to finance that
      expedition when she became your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" muttered Braddock, stroking his fat chin. "I said a few foolish
      things to her last night when I was heated up. She may not forgive me,
      Hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman will forgive anything to the man she loves," said Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock was no fool, and could not help casting a glance at his tubby
      figure, which was reflected in a near mirror. It seemed incredible that
      Mrs. Jasher could love him for his looks, and the fact that he might some
      day be a baronet did not strike him at the moment as a consideration.
      However, he foresaw trouble and expense should Don Pedro go to law, as he
      seemed determined to do. Taking all things into consideration, Braddock
      thought that Archie's judgment was a good one, and yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said after reflection, "let us agree. I shall open the case and
      examine the mummy, which after all is the reason why I bought it. When I
      have satisfied myself as to the difference between the modes of embalming,
      Don Pedro can give me a check and take away the mummy. I only hope that he
      will have less trouble with it than I have had," and, so speaking,
      Braddock, signing to Cockatoo to bring all the necessary tools, laid hands
      on the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am content," said Don Pedro briefly, and seated himself in a chair
      beside the young Daniel who had delivered judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope offered to assist the Professor to open the case, but was dismissed
      with an abrupt refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though I am glad you are present to see the mummy unpacked," said
      Braddock, laboring at the lid of the case, "for if the emeralds are
      missing, Don Pedro might accuse me of stealing them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should the emeralds be missing?" asked Hope quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sidney Bolton was killed," said he in a low voice, "and it was not likely
      that any one would commit a murder for the sake of this mummy, and then
      leave it stranded in Mrs. Jasher's garden. I have my doubts about the
      safety of the emeralds, else I would not have consented to sell the thing
      back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this honest speech, the Professor vigorously attacked the lid of the
      case, and inserted a steel instrument into the cracks to prize up the
      covering. The lid was closed with wooden pegs in an antique but perfectly
      safe manner, and apparently had not been opened since the dead Inca had
      been laid to rest therein hundreds of years ago among the Andean
      mountains. Don Pedro winced at this desecration of the dead, but, as he
      had given his consent, there was nothing left to do but to grin and bear
      it. In a wonderfully short space of time, considering the neatness of the
      workmanship and the holding power of the wooden pegs, the lid was removed.
      Then the four on-lookers saw that the mummy had been tampered with.
      Swathed in green-stained llama wool, it lay rigid in its case. But the
      swathings had been cut; the hands protruded and the emeralds were gone&mdash;torn
      rudely from the hard grip of the dead.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. AN ACCUSATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Both Don Pedro and Professor Braddock were amazed and angry at the
      disappearance of the jewels, but Hope did not express much surprise.
      Considering the facts of the murder, it was just what he expected,
      although it must be confessed that he was wise after the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I refer you to your own words immediately before the case was opened,
      Professor," he remarked, after the first surprise had subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Words! words!" snapped Braddock, who was anything but pleased. "What
      words of mine do you mean, Hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said that it was not likely that any one would commit a murder for
      the sake of the mummy only, and then leave it stranded in Mrs. Jasher's
      garden. Also, you declared that you had your doubts about the safety of
      the emeralds, else you would not have consented to sell the mummy again to
      its rightful owner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so: quite so. And what I say I hold to," he retorted, "especially
      as I have proved myself a true prophet. You can both see for yourselves,"
      he waved his hand towards the rifled case, "that poor Sidney must have
      been killed for the sake of the emeralds. The question is, who killed
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person who knew about the jewels," said Don Pedro promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course: but who did know? I was ignorant until you told me about the
      manuscript. And you, Hope?" He searched Archie's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you intend to accuse me?" questioned the young man with a slight
      laugh. "I assure you, Professor, that I was ignorant of what had been
      buried with the corpse, until Don Pedro related his story the other night
      to myself and Random, and the ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock turned impatiently to De Gayangos, as he did not approve of
      Archie's apparent flippancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does any one else know of the contents of this manuscript?" he demanded
      irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro nursed his chin and looked musingly on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is just possible that Vasa may."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vasa? Vasa? Oh yes, the sailor who stole the mummy thirty years ago from
      your father in Lima. Pooh! pooh! pooh! You tell me that this manuscript is
      written in Latin, and evidently in monkish Latin at that, which is of the
      worst. Your sailor could not read it, and would not know the value of the
      manuscript. If he had, he would have carried it off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Senor," said the Peruvian politely, "I have an idea that my father made a
      translation of this manuscript, or at all events a copy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I understood," put in Hope, still astride of his chair, "that you did
      not find the original manuscript until your father died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is quite true, sir," assented the other readily, "but I did not tell
      you everything the other night. My father it was who found the manuscript
      at Cuzco, and although I cannot state authoritatively, yet I believe I am
      correct in saying that he had a copy made. But whether the copy was merely
      a transcript or actually a translation, I cannot tell. I think it was the
      former, as if Vasa, reading a translation, had learned of the jewels, he
      undoubtedly would have stolen them before selling this mummy to the
      Parisian collector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he did," said Braddock, pointing to the rifled corpse. "You see
      that the emeralds are missing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your assistant's assassin stole them," insisted Don Pedro coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We cannot be sure of that," retorted the Professor, "although I admit
      that no man would jeopardize his neck for the sake of a corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But an enthusiast such as you are, Professor, might risk so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      For once in his life Braddock made a good-humored reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. Not even for this mummy would I place myself in the power of the
      law. And I do not think that any other scientist would either. We savants
      may not be worldly, but we are not fools. However, the fact remains that
      the jewels are gone, and whether they were stolen by Vasa thirty years
      ago, or by poor Sidney's assassin the other day, I don't know, and, what
      is more, I don't care. I shall examine the mummy further, and in a couple
      of days Don Pedro can bring me a check for one thousand and remove his
      ancestor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no!" cried the Peruvian hurriedly; "since the emeralds are missing, I
      am not in a position to pay you one thousand English pounds, sir. I want
      to take back the body of Inca Caxas to Lima; as one must show respect to
      one's ancestors. But the fact is, I cannot pay the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said that you could," shouted the exasperated Professor in his
      bullying way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admit it, senor, but I had hoped to do so when I sold the emeralds,
      which&mdash;as you can see&mdash;are not available. Therefore the body of
      my royal ancestor must remain here until I can procure the money. And it
      may be that Sir Frank Random will help me in this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wouldn't help me," snapped Braddock, "so why should he help you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro, looking more dignified than ever, drew himself up to his tall
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Frank," he said, in a stately way, "has done me the honor of seeking
      to be my son-in-law. As my daughter loves him, I am willing to permit the
      marriage, but now that I have learned the emeralds are lost, I shall not
      consent until Sir Frank buys the mummy from you, Professor. It is only
      right that my daughter's hand should redeem her regal forefather from
      purely scientific surroundings and that she should take the mummy back to
      be buried in Lima. At the same time, sir, I must say that I am the
      rightful owner of the dead, and that you should surrender the mummy to me
      free of charge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, and lose a thousand pounds!" cried Braddock furiously. "No, sir, I
      shall do nothing of the sort. You only wanted the mummy for the sake of
      the jewels, and now that they are lost, you do not care what becomes of
      your confounded ancestor, and you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor would have gone on still more furiously, but that Hope,
      seeing Don Pedro was growing angry at the insult, chimed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me throw oil on the troubled waters," he said, smoothly. "Don Pedro
      is not able to redeem the mummy until the emeralds are found. As such is
      the case, we must find the emeralds and enable him to do what is
      necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how are we to find the jewels?" asked Braddock crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By finding the assassin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that to be done?" asked De Gayangos gloomily. "I have been doing
      my best at Pierside, but I cannot find a single clue. Vasa is not to be
      found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vasa!" exclaimed Archie and the Professor, both profoundly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Vasa, if anyone, must have killed your assistant, since he
      alone could have known that the jewels were buried with Inca Caxas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear sir," argued Hope good-naturedly, "if Vasa stole the
      manuscript, whether translated or not, he certainly must have learned the
      truth long, long ago, since thirty years have elapsed. In that event he
      must have stolen the jewels, as Professor Braddock remarked lately, before
      he sold the mummy to the Parisian collector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be so," said Don Pedro obstinately, while the Professor muttered
      his approval, "but we cannot be certain on that point. No one&mdash;I
      agree with the Professor in this&mdash;would have risked his neck to steal
      a mere mummy, therefore the motive for the committal of the crime must
      have been the emeralds. Only Vasa knew of their existence outside myself
      and my dead father. He, therefore, must be the assassin. I shall hunt for
      him, and, when I find him, I shall have him arrested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can't possibly recognize the man after thirty years?" argued
      Braddock disbelievingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a royal memory for faces," said Don Pedro imperturbably, "and in
      the past I saw much of Vasa. He was then a young sailor of twenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" muttered Braddock. "He is now fifty, and must have changed in
      thirty years. You'll never recognize him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think so," said the Peruvian smoothly. "His eyes were peculiarly
      blue and full of light. Also, he had a scar on the right temple from a
      blow which he received in a street riot in which I also was concerned.
      Finally, gentlemen, Vasa loved a peon girl on my father's estate, and she
      induced him to have the sun encircled by a serpent&mdash;a Peruvian symbol&mdash;tattooed
      on his left wrist. With all these marks, and with my memory for faces,
      which never yet has failed me, I have no doubt but what I shall recognize
      the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then I shall have him arrested"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope shrugged his square shoulders. He had not much belief in Don Pedro's
      boasted royal memory, and did not think that he would recognize a young
      sailor of twenty in what would certainly be a grizzled old salt of fifty
      years. However, it was possible that the man might be right in his
      surmise, since Vasa alone could have known about the emeralds. The only
      doubt was whether he would have waited for thirty years before looting the
      mummy. Archie said nothing of these thoughts, as they would only serve to
      prolong an unprofitable discussion. But he made one suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your best plan," he said suggestively, "is to write a description of Vasa&mdash;who,
      by the way, has probably changed his name&mdash;and hand it to the police,
      with the promise of a reward if he is found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very poor, senor. Surely the Professor here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can offer nothing," said Braddock quickly, "as I am quite as poor as
      you are, if not more so, Sir Frank might help," he added sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not ask," said Don Pedro loftily. "If Sir Frank chooses to become
      my son-in-law by purchasing back my royal ancestor, to which you have no
      right, I am willing that it should be so. But, poor as I am, I shall offer
      a reward myself, since the honor of the De Gayangoses is involved in this
      matter. What reward do you suggest, Mr. Hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five hundred pounds," said the Professor quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too much," said Hope sharply&mdash;"far too much. Make the reward one
      hundred pounds, Don Pedro. That is enough to tempt many a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Peruvian bowed and noted down the amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall go at once to Pierside and see Inspector Date, who had to do with
      the inquest," he remarked. "Meanwhile, Professor, please do not desecrate
      my royal ancestor's body more than you can help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall certainly not search for any more emeralds," retorted Braddock
      dryly. "Now, clear out, both of you, and leave me to examine the mummy.
      Cockatoo, show these gentlemen out, and let no one else in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro returned to the Warrior Hotel to inform his daughter of what had
      taken place, with the intention of going in the afternoon to Pierside.
      Meanwhile, he wrote out a full description of Vasa, making an allowance
      for the lapse of years and explaining the scar and the symbol on the left
      wrist. Hope also sought Lucy and related the latest development of the
      case. The girl was not surprised, as she likewise believed that the
      assassin had desired more than the mummy when he murdered Sidney Bolton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jasher did not know about the emeralds?" she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Archie, much surprised. "Surely you do not suspect her of
      having a hand in the devilment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," was the prompt answer. "Only I cannot understand how the
      mummy came to be in her garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was brought up from the river, I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why to Mrs. Jasher's garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell that. The whole thing is a mystery, and seems likely to
      remain so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me," said the girl, after a pause, "that it would be best for
      my father to return this mummy to Don Pedro, and have done with it, since
      it seems to bring bad luck. Then he can marry Mrs. Jasher, and go to Egypt
      on her fortune to seek for this tomb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt very much if Mrs. Jasher will marry the Professor now, after what
      he said last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, my father was in a rage and said what first came into his mind.
      I daresay she is angry. However, I shall see her this afternoon, and put
      matters right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very anxious that the Professor should marry the lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," replied Lucy seriously, "as I want to leave my father comfortably
      settled when I marry you. The sooner he makes Mrs. Jasher his wife, the
      readier will he be to let me go, and I want to marry you as soon as I
      possibly can. I am tired of Gartley and of this present life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course to this speech Archie could make only one answer, and as that
      took the form of kissing, it was entirely satisfactory to Miss Kendal.
      Then they discussed the future and also the proposed engagement of Sir
      Frank Random to the Peruvian lady. But both left the subject of the mummy
      alone, as they were quite weary of the matter, and neither could suggest a
      solution of the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Professor Braddock had passed a very pleasant hour in examining
      the swathings of the mummy. But his pleasure was destined to be cut short
      sooner than he desired, as Captain Hiram Hervey unexpectedly arrived.
      Although Cockatoo&mdash;as he had been instructed&mdash;did his best to
      keep him out, the sailor forced his way in, and heralded his appearance by
      throwing the Kanaka head-foremost into the museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does this mean?" demanded the fiery Professor, while Cockatoo, with
      an angry expression, struggled to his feet, and Hervey, smoking his
      inevitable cheroot, stood on the threshold&mdash;"how dare you treat my
      property in this careless way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess your property should behave itself then," said the captain in
      careless tones, and sauntered into the room. "D'y think I'm goin' to be
      chucked out by a measly nigger and&mdash;Great Scott!"&mdash;this latter
      exclamation was extorted by the sight of the mummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock motioned to the still angry Cockatoo to move aside, and then
      nodded triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't expect to see that, did you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey came to anchor on a chair and turned the cheroot in his mouth with
      an odd look at the mummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will he be hanged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will who be hanged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man as stole that thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We haven't found him yet," Braddock informed him swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how in creation did you annex the corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor sat down and explained. The lean, long mariner listened
      quietly, only nodding at intervals. He did not seem to be surprised when
      he heard that the corpse of the head Inca had been found in Mrs. Jasher's
      garden, especially when Braddock explained the whereabouts of the
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal," he drawled, "that don't make my hair stand on end. I guess the
      garden was on his way and he used it for a cemetery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you talking about?" demanded the perplexed scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the man who strangled your help and yanked away the corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't know who he is. Nobody knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go slow. I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" Braddock started and flung himself across the room to seize Hervey
      by the lapels of his reefer coat. "You know. Tell me who he is, so that I
      can get the emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emeralds!" Hervey removed Braddock's plump hands and stared greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know? No, of course you don't. But two emeralds were buried
      with the mummy, and they have been stolen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who by?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt by the assassin who murdered poor Sidney."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey spat on the floor, and his weather-beaten face took on an
      expression of, profound regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I'm a fool of the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Braddock, again puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To think," said Hervey, addressing the mummy, "that you were on board my
      boat, and I never looted you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" Braddock stamped. "Would you have committed theft?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Theft be hanged!" was the reply. "It ain't thieving to loot the dead. I
      guess a corpse hasn't got any use for jewels. You bet I'd have gummed
      straightways onto that mummy, when I brought it from Malta in the old
      Diver, had I known it was a jeweler's shop of sorts. Huh! Two emeralds,
      and I never knew. I could kick myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a blackguard," gasped the astonished Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, shucks!" was the elegant retort, "give it a rest. I'm no worse than
      that dandy gentleman who added murder to stealing, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" Braddock bounded off his chair like an india-rubber ball, "you said
      that you knew who had committed the murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal," drawled Hervey again, "I do and I don't. That is I suspect, but I
      can't swear to the business before a judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who killed Bolton?" asked the Professor furiously. "Tell me at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not me, unless it's made worth my while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be, by Don Pedro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That yellow-stomach. What's he got to do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just told you the mummy belongs to him; he came to Europe to find
      it. He wants the emeralds, and intends to offer a reward of one hundred
      pounds for the discovery of the assassin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey arose briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm right on the job," said he, sauntering to the door. "I'll go to that
      old inn of yours, where you say the Don's stopping, and look him up. Guess
      I'll trade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who killed Bolton?" asked Braddock, running to the door and gripping
      Hervey by his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mariner looked down on the anxious face of the plump little man with a
      grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell you," said he, "as you can't figure out the business, unless
      I'm on the racket. No, sir; I'm the white boy in thin circus."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor shook the lean sailor in his anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That almighty aristocrat that came on board my ship, when I lay in the
      Thames on the very afternoon I arrived with Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who do you mean?" demanded Braddock, more and more perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Frank Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! did he kill Bolton and steal my mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And hide it in that garden on his way to the Fort? I guess he did."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor sat down and closed his eyes with horror. When he opened
      them again, Hervey was gone.

      CHAPTER XVI. THE MANUSCRIPT AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      But the Professor was not going to let Captain Hervey escape without
      giving him full information. Before the Yankee skipper could reach the
      front door, Braddock was at his heels, gasping and blowing like a grampus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back, come back. Tell me all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon not," rejoined the mariner, removing Braddock's grip. "You ain't
      the one to give the money. I'll go to the Don, or to Inspector Date of
      Pierside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Sir Frank must be innocent," insisted Braddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's got to prove it," was the dry response. "Let me go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. You must tell me on what grounds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the devil take you!" said Hervey hastily, and sat down on one of the
      hall chairs. "It's this way, since you won't let me skip until I tell you.
      This almighty aristocrat came to Pierside on the same afternoon as I cast
      anchor. While Bolton was on board, he looked in to have a yarn of sorts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, how in creation should I know?" snapped the skipper. "I wasn't on
      hand, as I'd enough to do with unloading cargo. But his lordship went with
      Bolton to the state-room, and they talked for half an hour. When they came
      out, I saw that his lordship had his hair riz, and heard him saying things
      to Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, for one, he said, `You'll repent of this,' and then again, `Your
      life isn't safe while you keep it.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meaning the mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon that's so, unless I am mistaken," said Hervey serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you go to the police with this information?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me? Not much. Why, I saw no way of making dollars. And then, again, I did
      not think of putting things together, until I found that his lorship&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meaning Sir Frank," interpolated the Professor, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm talking Queen's, or King's, or Republican lingo, I guess, and I do
      mean his lorship," said the skipper dryly&mdash;"until I found that his
      lorship had been in the public-house where the crime was committed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Sailor's Rest? When did he go there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the evening. After his talk with Bolton, and after a row&mdash;as they
      both seemed to have their hair off&mdash;he skipped over the side and went
      back to his yacht, which wasn't far away. Bolton took his blamed mummy
      ashore and got fixed at the Sailor's Rest. I gathered afterwards, from the
      second mate of The Diver (which ain't my ship now), that his lorship came
      into the hotel and had a drink. Afterwards my second mate saw him talking
      to Bolton through the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the same place as the woman talked?" questioned the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, only it was later in the evening that the woman came along to
      give chin-music through the window. I am bound to say," added the captain
      generously, "that no one I can place my hand on saw his lorship loafing
      about the hotel after dark. But what of that? He may have laid his plans,
      and arranged for the corpse to be found later, in that blamed packing
      case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this all your evidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's enough, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to procure a warrant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, a man in the States would be electrocuted on half the evidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay," retorted the little man with contempt, "but we are in a land
      where justice of the purest prevails. All your evidence is circumstantial.
      It proves nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was considerably nettled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I calculate that it proves Sir Frank wanted the mummy, else why did he
      come on board my ship to see your infernal assistant. The words he used
      showed that he was warning Bolton how he'd do for him. And then he talked
      through the window, and was in the public-house, which ain't a place for
      an almighty aristocrat to shelter in. I guess he's the man wanted by the
      police. Why," added Hervey, warming to his tale, "he'd a slap-up yacht
      laying near the blamed hotel, and could easily ship the corpse, after
      slipping it through the window. When he got tired of it, and looted the
      emeralds, he took it by boat, below the Fort, to Mrs. Jasher's garden and
      left it there, so as to pull the wool over the eyes of the police. It's as
      clear as mud to me. You search his lorship's shanty, and you'll find the
      emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is strange," muttered Braddock unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange, but not true," said a voice from the head of the stairs, and
      young Hope came down leisurely, with a pale face, but a very determined
      air. "Random is absolutely innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?" demanded the skipper contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he is an English gentleman and my very good friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! I guess that defense won't save him from being lynched."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Braddock was looking irritably at Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been listening to a private conversation, sir. How dare you
      listen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you hold private conversations at the top of your voices in the hall,
      you must be expected to be listened to," said Archie coolly. "I plead
      guilty, and I am not sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In time to hear all that Captain Hervey has explained. I was chatting
      with Lucy, and had just left her, when I heard your loud voices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Lucy heard anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. She is busy in her room. But I'll tell her," Hope turned to mount the
      stairs; "she likes Random, and will no more believe him guilty than I do
      at this present moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" cried Braddock, flying forward to pull Hope back, as he placed his
      foot on the first stair. "Tell Lucy nothing just now. We must go to the
      Fort, you&mdash;and I, to see Random. Hervey, you come also, and then you
      can accuse Sir Frank to his face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he dares to do it!" said Archie, who looked and felt indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'll accuse him right enough when the time comes," said Hervey in his
      coolest manner, "but the time isn't now. Savy! I am going to see the Don
      first and make sure of this reward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faugh!" cried Hope with disgust, "Blood-money!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of that? Ifs a man is a murderer he should be lynched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, Sir Frank Random, is no murderer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's got to prove, that, as I said before," rejoined the Yankee in a calm
      way, and strolled to the door. "So-long, gents both. I'll light out for
      the Warrior Inn and play my cards. And I may tell you," he added, pausing
      at the door, which he opened, "that I haven't got that blamed wind-jammer,
      so need money to hold out until another steamer comes along. One hundred
      pounds English currency will just fill the bill. So now you know the lay
      I'm on. So-long," and he walked quietly out of the house, leaving Archie
      and Braddock looking at one another with pale faces. The assurance of
      Hervey surprised and horrified them. Still, they could not believe that
      Sir Frank Random had been guilty of so brutal a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For one thing," said Hope after a pause, "Random did not know where the
      emeralds were to be found, or even that they existed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understood that he did know," said Braddock reluctantly. "In my
      hearing, and in your own, you heard Don Pedro state that he had related
      the story of the manuscript to Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget that I learned about the emeralds at the same time," said Hope
      quietly. "Yet this Yankee skipper does not accuse me. The knowledge of the
      emeralds came to Random's ears and to mine long after the crime was
      committed. To have a motive for killing Bolton and stealing the emeralds,
      Random would have had to know when he arrived in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should he have not known?" asked the Professor, biting his lip
      vexedly. "I don't want to accuse Random, or even to doubt him, as he is a
      very good fellow, even though he refused to assist me with money when I
      desired a reward to be offered. All the same, he met Don Pedro in Genoa,
      and it is just possible that the man told him of the jewels buried with
      the mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt that," said he thoughtfully. "Random was as astonished as the
      rest of us, when Don Pedro told his Arabian Night story. However, the
      point can be easily settled by sending for Random. I daresay he is at the
      Fort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall send Cockatoo for him at once," said the Professor quickly, and
      walked into the museum to instruct the Kanaka. Archie remained where he
      was, and seated himself on a chair, with folded arms and knitted brows. It
      was incredible that an English gentleman with a stainless name and such a
      well-known soldier should commit so terrible a crime. And the matter of
      Hervey's accusation was complicated by the fact&mdash;of which Hervey was
      ignorant&mdash;that Don Pedro was willing that Random should become his
      son-in-law. Hope wondered what the fiery, proud Peruvian would say when he
      heard his friend denounced. His reflections on this point were cut short
      by the return of the Professor, who appeared at the door of the museum
      dismissing Cockatoo. When the Kanaka took his departure, Braddock beckoned
      to the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no reason why we should talk in the hall, and let the whole
      house know of this new difficulty," he said in a testy manner. "Come in
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope entered and looked with ill-concealed repugnance at the uncanny shape
      of the green mummy, which was lying on a long table. He examined the
      portions where the swathings had been cut with some sharp instrument, to
      reveal the dry, bony hands, which formerly had held the costly jewels. The
      face was invisible and covered with a mask of dull beaten gold. Formerly
      the eyes had been jeweled, but these last were now absent. He pointed out
      the mask to the Professor, who was hovering over the weird dead with a
      large magnifying-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is strange," said Hope earnestly, "that the mask of gold was not
      stolen also, since it is so valuable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless melted down, the mask could be traced," said Braddock after a
      pause. "The jewels, according to Don Pedro, are of immense value, and so
      could have been got rid of easily. Random was satisfied with those."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk of him in that way, as though his guilt was certain," said
      Hope, wincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you must admit that the evidence against him is strong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But purely circumstantial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Circumstantial evidence has hanged many an innocent man before now.
      Humph!" said Braddock uneasily, "I hope it won't hang our friend. However,
      we shall hear what he has to say. I have sent Cockatoo to the Fort to
      bring him here at once. If Random is absent, Cockatoo is to leave a note
      in his room, on the writing-table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it not have been better to have told Cockatoo to give the note to
      Random's servant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not," responded Braddock dryly. "Random's servant is certainly
      one of the most stupid men in the entire army. He would probably forget to
      give him the note, and as it is important that we should see Random at
      once, it is better that he should find it placed personally on his
      writing-table by Cockatoo, upon whom I can depend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie abandoned the argument, as it really mattered very little. He took
      up another line of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect if the criminal tries to dispose of the emeralds he will be
      caught," said he: "such large jewels are too noticeable to escape
      comment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! It depends upon the cleverness of the thief," said the Professor,
      who was more taken up with the mummy than with the conversation, "He might
      have the jewels cut into smaller stones, or he might go to India and
      dispose of them to some Rajah, who would certainly say nothing. I don't
      know how criminals act myself, as I have never studied their methods. But
      I hope that the clue you mention will be hit upon, if only for Random's
      sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe for one moment that Random is in danger," said Archie,
      "and, if he is, I shall turn detective myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you joy," replied Braddock, bending over the mummy. "Look, Hope,
      at the wonderful color of this wool. There are some arts we have lost
      completely&mdash;dyeing of this surprising beauty is one. Humph!" mused
      the archaeologist, "I wonder why this particular mummy is dyed green, or
      rather why it is wrapped in green bandages. Yellow was the royal color of
      the ancient Peruvian monarchs. Vicuna wool dyed yellow. What do you think,
      Hope? It is strange."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can say nothing, because I know nothing," he said sharply. "All I do
      know is that I wish this precious mummy had never been brought here. It
      has caused trouble ever since its arrival."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Braddock, surveying the dead with some disfavor, "I must say
      that I shall be glad to see the last of it myself. I know now all that I
      wanted to know! Humph! I wonder if Don Pedro will allow me to strip the
      mummy? Of course! It is mine not his. I shall unswathe it entirely," and
      Braddock was about to lay sacrilegious hands on the dead, when Cockatoo
      entered breathlessly. He had been so quick that he must have run to the
      Fort and back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knock at door," said the Kanaka, delivering his message, "and I hear no
      voice. I go in and find no one, so I put the letter on the table. I come
      down and ask, and a soldier tells me, sir, his master is coming back in
      half an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should have waited," said Braddock, waving Cockatoo aside. "Come
      along with me to the Fort, Hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Random will come here as soon as he returns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely, but I can't wait. I am anxious to hear what he has to say in
      his defense. Come, Cockatoo, my coat, my hat, my gloves. Stir yourself,
      you scoundrel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie was not unwilling to go, since he was anxious also to hear what
      Random would say to the absurd accusation brought against him by the
      Yankee. In a few minutes the two men were walking smartly down the road
      through the village, the Professor striving to keep up with Hope's longer
      legs by trotting as hard as he could. Halfway down the village they met a
      trap, and in it Captain Hervey being driven to the Jessum railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen Don Pedro?" asked the Professor, stopping the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon not," answered Hervey stolidly. "He's gone into Pierside to see
      the police. I'm off there also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better come with us," said Archie sternly;&mdash;"we are going to
      see Sir Frank Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him my respects," said the skipper cold-bloodedly, "and say that
      he's worth one hundred pounds to me," he waved his hand and the trap moved
      away, but he looked back with a wry smile. "Say I'll square the matter for
      double the money and command of his yacht."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock and Archie looked after the trap in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a scoundrel the man is!" said the Professor pettishly; "he'd sell
      his father for what he could get."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shows how much his word is to be depended upon. I expect this
      accusation of Random is a put-up job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, for Random's sake," said Braddock, trotting briskly along.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time they arrived at the Fort and were informed that Sir Frank
      had not yet returned, but was expected back every moment. In the
      meanwhile, as Braddock and Hope were both extremely well known, they were
      shown into Random's quarters, which were on the first floor. When the
      soldier-servant retired and the door was closed, Hope seated himself near
      the window, while Braddock trotted round, looking into things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a dog kennel," said the Professor. "I told Random that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps we should have waited him in the mess," suggested Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! no! We couldn't talk there, with a lot of silly young fools
      hanging about. I told Random that I would never enter the mess, so he
      invited me to come always to his quarters. He was in love with Lucy then,"
      chuckled the Professor, "and nothing was too good for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even the dog kennel," said Hope dryly, for the Professor's chatter
      was so rude as to be quite annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! pooh! pooh! Random doesn't mind a joke. You, Hope, have no sense of
      humor. Your name is Scotch also. I believe you are a Caledonian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am nothing of the sort. I was born on this side of the border."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might have been born at the North Pole for all I care," said the
      little man politely. "I don't like artists: they are usually silly. I wish
      Lucy had married a man of science. Now don't talk rubbish. I know what you
      are going to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Archie, humoring him, "what am I going to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This non-plussed the irritable savant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum! Hum! hum! I don't know and don't care. Pouf! How hot this room is!
      What a number of books of travel Random has!" Braddock was now at the
      bookcase, which consisted of shelves swung by cords against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Random travels a great deal," Archie reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so: quite so. Wastes his money on that silly yacht. But he hasn't
      traveled in South America. I expect he's going there. Come here, Hope, and
      see the many, many books about Peru and Chili and Brazil. There must be a
      dozen, and all library books too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie sauntered towards the shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect Random is getting up the subject of South America, so as to talk
      to Donna Inez."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably! probably!" snapped Braddock, pulling several of the books out
      of place. "Why, there isn't a&mdash;Ah, dear me! What a catastrophe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He might well say so, for in his desire to examine the books, they all
      tipped off the shelves and lay in a disorderly heap on the floor. Hope
      began to pick them up and replace them, and so did the author of the
      mischief. Among the books were several papers scribbled with notes, and
      Braddock bundled these all in a heap.. Shortly, he caught sight of the
      writing on one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo! Latin," said he, and read a line or two. "Oh!" he gasped, "Hope!
      Hope! The manuscript of Don Pedro!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie rose and stared at the discolored paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to have kept you," said Random, entering at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You villain!" shouted Braddock furiously, "so you are guilty after all?"
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Random was so taken aback by the fierce accusation of the Professor that
      he stood suddenly still at the door, and did not advance into the room.
      Yet he did not look so much afraid as puzzled. Whatever Braddock might
      have thought, Hope, from the expression on the young soldier's face, was
      more than ever satisfied of his innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you talking about, Professor?" asked Random, genuinely
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know well enough," retorted the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word I don't," said the other, walking into the room and
      unbuckling his sword. "I find you here, with the contents of my bookcase
      on the floor, and you promptly accuse me of being guilty. Of what, I
      should like to know? Perhaps you can tell me Hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need for Hope to tell you, sir. You are perfectly well aware
      of your own villainy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I allow a certain amount of latitude to my guests, Professor," he said
      with marked dignity, "but for a man of your age and position you go too
      far. Be more explicit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me to speak," intervened Archie, anticipating Braddock. "Random,
      the Professor has just had a visit from Captain Hiram Hervey, who was the
      skipper of The Diver. He accuses you of having murdered Bolton!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" the baronet started back, looking thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment. I have not finished yet. Hervey accuses you of this
      murder, of stealing the mummy, of gaining possession of the emeralds, and
      of placing the rifled corpse in Mrs. Jasher's garden, so that she might be
      accused of committing the crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly," cried Braddock, seeing that his host remained silent from sheer
      surprise. "Hope has stated the case very clearly. Now, sir, your defense?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Defense! defense!" Random found his tongue at last and spoke indignantly.
      "I have no defense to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Then you acknowledge your guilt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I acknowledge nothing. The accusation is too preposterous for any denial
      to be necessary. Do you believe this of me?" He looked from one to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't," said Archie quickly, "there is some mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Hope. And you, Professor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock fidgeted about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to think," he said at length. "Hervey spoke very
      decisively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed," returned Random dryly, and, walking to the door, he locked
      it. "In that case, I must ask you for an explanation, and neither of you
      shall leave this room until one is given. Your proofs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is one of them," snapped Braddock, throwing the manuscript on the
      table. "Where did you get this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Random took up the discolored paper with a bewildered air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never set eyes on this before," he said, much puzzled. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A copy of the manuscript mentioned by Don Pedro, which describes the two
      emeralds buried with the mummy of Inca Caxas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see." Random understood all in a moment. "So you say that I knew of the
      emeralds from this, and so murdered Bolton to obtain them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," said Braddock with elaborate politeness. "Hervey says that
      you murdered my poor assistant, and although my discovery of this
      manuscript proves that you must have known about the jewels, I say
      nothing. I wait to hear your defense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very good of you," remarked Sir Frank ironically. "So it seems
      that I am in the dock. Perhaps the counsel for the prosecution will state
      the evidence against me," and he looked again from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie shook the baronet by the hand very warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," he declared decidedly, "I don't believe one word of the
      evidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case there must be a flaw in it," retorted Random, but did not
      seem to be unmoved by Hope's generous action. "Sit down, Professor; it
      appears that you are against me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Until I hear your defense," said the old man obstinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot make any until I hear your evidence. Go on. I am waiting," and
      Sir Frank flung himself into a chair, where he sat calmly, his eyes
      steadily fixed on the Professor's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you get that manuscript?" asked Braddock sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got it nowhere: this is the first time I have seen it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet it was hidden amongst your books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can't say how it got there. Were you looking for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Certainly not. To pass the time while waiting, I examined your
      library, and in pulling out a book, your case, being a swing one,
      over-balanced and shot its contents on to the floor. Amongst the papers
      which fell with the books, I caught a glimpse of the manuscript, and,
      noting that it was written in Latin, I picked it up, surprised to think
      that a frivolous young man, such as you are, should study a dead language.
      A few words showed me that the manuscript was a copy of the one referred
      to by Don Pedro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment," said Archie, who had been thinking. "Perhaps this is the
      original manuscript, which De Gayangos has given to you, Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is good of you to afford me a loophole of escape," said Sir Frank,
      leaning back with folded arms, "but De Gayangos gave me nothing. I saw the
      manuscript in his hands, when he showed it to us all at Mrs. Jasher's. But
      whether this is the original or a copy I can't say. Don Pedro certainly
      did not give it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Don Pedro been in your quarters?" asked Hope thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. He has only visited me in the mess. And even if Don Pedro did come in
      here&mdash;for I guess what is in your mind&mdash;I really do not see why
      he should slip a manuscript which he values highly amongst my books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you really never saw this before?" said Braddock, indicating the
      paper on the table, and impressed by Random's earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How often do you want me to deny it?" retorted the young man impatiently.
      "Perhaps you will state on what grounds I am accused?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock nodded and cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Hervey declared that your yacht arrived at Pierside almost at the
      same time as his steamer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right. When Don Pedro received a wire from Malta stating that the
      mummy had been sold to you, and that it was being shipped to London on The
      Diver, I got up steam at once, and chased the tramp to that port. As the
      tramp was slow, and my boat was fast, I arrived on the same day and almost
      at the same hour, even though Hervey's boat had the start of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why were you anxious to follow The Diver?" asked Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro wished to get back the mummy, and asked me to follow. As I was
      in love with Donna Inez, and still am, I was only too willing to oblige
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hervey says that you went on board The Diver, and had an interview with
      Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is perfectly true, and my visit was paid for the same reason as I
      followed the steamer to London&mdash;that is, I acted on behalf of Don
      Pedro. I wished to ascertain for certain that the mummy was on board, and
      having done so from Bolton, I urged him to induce you to give back the
      same, free of charge, to De Gayangos, from whom it had been stolen. He
      refused, as he declared that he intended to deliver it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew I could always trust Bolton," said the Professor enthusiastically.
      "It would have been better for you to have come to me, Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay; but I wished, as I told you, to make certain that the mummy
      was on board. That was the real reason for my visit; but, being in
      Bolton's company, I naturally told him that Don Pedro claimed the mummy as
      his property, and warned him that if you or he kept the same, that there
      would be trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you use threats?" asked Hope, remembering what he had overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you did," cried Braddock quickly. "Hervey declares that you told
      Bolton that he would repent of keeping the mummy, and that his life would
      not be safe while he held it."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the surprise of both visitors, Random admitted using these serious
      threats without a moment's hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro told me that many Indians, both in Lima and Cuzco, who look
      upon him as the lawful descendant of the last Inca, are anxiously
      expecting the return of the royal mummy. He also stated that when the
      Indians knew who held the mummy they would send one of themselves to get
      it back, if he&mdash;Don Pedro, that is&mdash;did not fetch it. To get
      back the mummy Don Pedro declared that these Indians would not stop short
      of murder. Hence my warning to Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" Archie jumped up with widely opened eyes. "Then perhaps this solves
      the problem. Bolton was murdered by some Peruvian Indian."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random shook his head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again you offer me a loophole of escape, my dear fellow," he said
      sententiously, "but that theory will not hold water. At present the
      Indians in Lima and Cuzco do not know that the mummy has been found. Don
      Pedro only chanced upon the paper which announced the sale by accident and
      had no time to communicate with his barbaric friends in South America.
      Failing to get the mummy from you, Professor, he would have returned to
      Peru and then would have told who possessed the corpse of Inca Caxas,
      leaving the Indians to deal with the matter. In that case my warning to
      Bolton would be necessary. But at the time I told him, it was not
      necessary. However, Bolton remained true to you, Professor, and declined
      to surrender the mummy. I therefore wired to Don Pedro at Genoa that the
      mummy was on board The Diver and was being sent to Gartley. I also advised
      him to come to me here in order to be introduced to you. The rest you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence. Then Archie, to test if Random was willing
      to admit everything&mdash;as an innocent man certainly would&mdash;asked
      significantly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see Bolton again after your interview on board ship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that the baronet proved his good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," he said easily and without hesitation. "I was walking about
      Pierside later, and, passing along that waterside alley near the Sailor's
      Rest, I saw a window on the ground floor open, and Bolton looking out
      across the river. I stopped and asked him when he proposed to take the
      mummy to Gartley, and if it was on shore. He admitted that it was in the
      hotel, but declined to say when he would send it on to you, Professor.
      When he closed the window, I afterwards went into the hotel and had a
      drink in order to ask casually when Mr. Bolton intended to leave. I
      gathered&mdash;not directly, of course, but in a roundabout way&mdash;that
      he had arranged to go next morning and to send on his luggage. Then I left
      and went to London. In the course of time I returned here and learned of
      the murder and the disappearance of the corpse of Inca Caxas. And now,"
      Random stood up, "having admitted all this, perhaps you will believe me to
      be innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no idea who murdered Bolton and placed his body in the packing
      case?" asked Braddock, manifestly disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No. No more than I have any idea of the person who placed the mummy case
      and its contents in Mrs. Jasher's garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you know that!" said Archie quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. The news was all over the village this morning. I could hardly help
      knowing it. And I believe that the mummy has been taken to your house,
      Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has," admitted Braddock dryly. "I took it myself from Mrs. Jasher's
      arbor in a hand-cart, with the assistance of Cockatoo. But when I made an
      examination this morning in the presence of Hope and Don Pedro, I found
      that the swathings of the body had been ripped up, and that the emeralds
      mentioned in that manuscript had been stolen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange!" said Random with a frown; "and by whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt by the assassin of Sidney Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably." Random kicked a mat straight with his foot. "At any rate the
      theft of the emeralds shows that it was not any Indian who killed Bolton.
      None of them would rifle so sacred a corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides which&mdash;as you say&mdash;the Indians in Peru do not know that
      the mummy has reappeared after thirty years' seclusion," chimed in Hope,
      rising. "Well, and what is to be done now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Sir Frank picked up the manuscript which still remained on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall see Don Pedro about this," he said quietly, "and ascertain if it
      is the original or a copy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock rose slowly and stared at the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know Latin?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," rejoined Random, knowing what the savant meant. "I learned it, of
      course, but I have forgotten much. I might translate a word or two, but
      certainly not the hedge-priest Latin in which this is written." He looked
      carefully at the manuscript as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who could have placed it in your room?" questioned Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We cannot learn that until we see Don Pedro. If this is the original
      manuscript which we saw the other night, we may learn how it passed from
      the possession of De Gayangos to my bookcase. If it is a copy, then we
      must learn, if possible, who owned it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro said that a transcript or a translation had been made,"
      mentioned Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evidently a transcript," said Braddock, glaring at the paper in Random's
      hand. "But how could that find its way from Lima to this place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might have been packed up with the mummy," suggested Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," contradicted Random decisively, "in that event, the man in Malta
      from whom the mummy was bought would have discovered the emeralds, and
      would have taken them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he did. We have nothing to show that Bolton's assassin committed
      the crime for the sake of the jewels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must have done so," cried the Professor, irritably, "else there is no
      motive for the commission of the crime. But I think myself that we must
      start at the other end to find a clue. When we discover who placed the
      mummy in Mrs. Jasher's garden&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will not be easy," murmured Hope thoughtfully, "though, of course,
      the same must have been brought by river. Let us go down to the embankment
      and see if there are any signs of a boat having been brought there last
      night," and he moved to the door. "Random?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot leave the Fort, as I am on duty," replied the officer, putting
      the manuscript away in a drawer and locking the same, "but this evening I
      shall see Don Pedro, and in the meanwhile I shall endeavor to learn from
      my servant who visited me lately while I was absent. The manuscript must
      have been brought here by someone. But I trust," he added as he escorted
      his two visitors to the door, "that you now acquit me of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! yes! yes!" cried Braddock, hastily cutting him short and shaking his
      hand. "I apologize for my suspicions. Now I maintain that you are
      innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I never believed you to be guilty," cried Hope heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you both," said Random simply, and, having closed the door, he
      returned to a chair near the fire to smoke a pipe, and meditate over his
      future movements. "An enemy hath done this," said Random, referring to the
      concealment of the manuscript, but he could think of no one who desired to
      harm him in any way.

      CHAPTER XVIII. RECOGNITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lucy and Mrs. Jasher were having a confidential conversation in the small
      pink drawing-room. True to her promise, Miss Kendal had come to readjust
      matters between the fiery little Professor and the widow. But it was not
      an easy task, as Mrs. Jasher was righteously indignant at the rash words
      used to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if I knew anything about the matter," she repeated again and again in
      angry tones. "Why, my dear, he as good as told me I had murdered&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy did not let her finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! there!" she said, speaking as she would have done to a fretful
      child, "you know what my father is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me that I am just beginning to learn," said the widow
      bitterly, "and knowing how ready he is to believe ill of me, I think it is
      better we should part for ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'll never be Lady Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even if I married him, I am not sure that I should be, since I learn that
      his brother is singularly healthy and comes of a long-lived family. And it
      will not be pleasant to live with your father when he has such a temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was only because he was excited. Think of your salon, and of the
      position you wish to hold in, London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well," said Mrs. Jasher, visibly softening, "there is something to be
      said there. After all, one can never find a man who is perfection. And a
      very amiable man is usually a fool. One can't expect a rose to be without
      thorns. But really, my dear," she surveyed Lucy with mild surprise, "you
      appear to be very anxious that I should marry your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see my father made comfortable before I marry Archie," said the
      girl with a blush. "Of course my father is quite a child in household
      affairs and needs everything done for him. Archie&mdash;I am glad to say&mdash;is
      now in a position to marry me in the spring. I want you to be married
      about the same time, and then you can live in Gartley, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear," said Mrs. Jasher firmly, "if I marry your father, he wishes
      us to go at once to Egypt in search of this tomb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that he wants you to help with the money left to you by your late
      brother. But surely you will not go up the Nile yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, certainly not," said the widow promptly. "I shall remain in Cairo
      while the Professor goes on his excursion into Ethiopia. I know that Cairo
      is a very charming place, and that I shall be able to enjoy myself there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have decided to forgive my father for his rash words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must," sighed Mrs. Jasher. "I am so tired of being an unprotected widow
      without a recognized position in the world. Even with my brother's money,&mdash;not
      that it is so very much&mdash;I shall still be looked upon askance if I go
      into society. But as Mrs. Braddock, or Lady Braddock, no one will dare to
      say a word against me. Yes, my dear, if your father comes and, asks my
      pardon he shall have it. We women are so weak," ended the widow
      virtuously, as if she was not making a virtue of necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things being thus settled, the two talked on amiably for some time, and
      discussed the chances of Random marrying Donna Inez. Both acknowledged
      that the Peruvian lady was handsome enough, but had not a word to say for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus chattering, Professor Braddock trotted into the room, looking
      brisk and bright from his stroll in the cold frosty air. Gifted as he was
      with scientific assurance, the little man was not at all taken aback by
      the cold reception of Mrs. Jasher, but rubbed his hands cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there you are, Selina," said he, looking like a bright-eyed robin. "I
      hope you are feeling well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you expect me to feel well after what you said?" remarked Mrs.
      Jasher reproachfully, and anxious to make a virtue of forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I beg pardon: I beg pardon. Surely, Selina, you are not going to make
      a fuss over a trifle like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not give you permission to call me Selina."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so. But as we are to be married, I may as well get used to your
      Christian name, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not so sure that we will be married," said Mrs. Jasher stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but we must," cried Braddock in dismay. "I am depending upon your
      money to finance my expedition to Queen Tahoser's tomb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," observed the widow coldly, while Lucy sat quietly by and allowed
      the elder woman to conduct the campaign, "you want me for my money. There
      is no love in the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, as soon as I have the time&mdash;say during our voyage to Cairo,
      whence we start inland up the Nile for Ethiopia&mdash;I shall make love
      whenever you like. And, confound it, Selina, I admire you no end&mdash;to
      use a slang phrase. You are a fine woman and a sensible woman, and I am
      afraid that you are throwing yourself away on a snuffy old man like
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no! no! Pray do not say that," cried Mrs. Jasher, visibly moved by
      this flattery. "You will make a very good husband if you will only strive
      to govern your temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Temper! temper! Bless the woman&mdash;I mean you, Selina&mdash;I have the
      very best temper in the world. However, you shall govern it and myself
      also if you like. Come," he took her hand, "let us be friends and fix the
      wedding day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher did not withdraw her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you do not believe that I have anything to do with this terrible
      murder?" she asked playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! I was heated last night. I spoke rashly and hastily. Forgive and
      forget, Selina. You are innocent&mdash;quite innocent, in spite of the
      mummy being in your confounded garden. After all, the evidence is stronger
      against Random than against you. Perhaps he put it there: it's on his way
      to the Fort, you see. Never mind. He has exonerated himself, and no doubt,
      when confronted with Hervey, will be able to silence that blackguard. And
      I am quite sure that Hervey is a blackguard," ended Braddock, rubbing his
      bald head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies looked at one another in amazement, not knowing what to
      say. They were ignorant of the theft of the emeralds and of the accusation
      of Sir Frank by the Yankee skipper. But, with his usual absentmindedness,
      Braddock had forgotten all about that, and sat in his chair rubbing his
      head quite pink and rattling on cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went down with Hope to the embankment," he continued, "but neither of
      us could see any sign of a boat. There's the rude, short jetty, of course,
      and if a boat came, a boat could go away without leaving any trace.
      Perhaps that is so. However, we must wait until we see Don Pedro and
      Hervey again, and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy broke in desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you talking about, father? Why do you bring in Sir Frank's name
      in that way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you expect me to say?" retorted the little man. "After all, the
      manuscript was found in his room, and the emeralds are gone. I saw that
      for myself, as did Hope and Don Pedro, in whose presence I opened the
      mummy case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher rose in her astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are the emeralds gone?" she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! yes! yes!" cried Braddock irritably. "Am I not telling you so? I
      almost believe in Hervey's accusation of Random, and yet the boy
      exonerated himself very forcibly&mdash;very forcibly indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you explain all that has happened, father?" said Lucy, who was
      becoming more and more perplexed by this rambling chatter. "We are quite
      in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I: so is Hope: so is every one," chuckled Braddock. "Ah, yes: of
      course, you were not present when these events took place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What events?&mdash;what events?" demanded Mrs. Jasher, now quite
      exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am about to tell you," snapped her future husband, and related all that
      had taken place since the arrival of Captain Hervey in the museum at the
      Pyramids. The women listened with interest and with growing astonishment,
      only interrupting the narrator with a simultaneous exclamation of
      indignation when they heard that Sir Frank was accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is utterly and wholly absurd," cried Lucy angrily. "Sir Frank is the
      soul of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I think, my dear," chimed in Mrs. Jasher. "And what does he say to&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am about to tell you, if you will stop talking," he cried crossly.
      "That is so like a woman. She asks for an explanation and then prevents
      the man from giving it. Random offers a very good defense, I am bound to
      say," and he detailed what Sir Frank had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the history was finished, Lucy rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall see Archie at once," she said, moving hastily, towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" demanded her father benignly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This thing can't go on," she declared resolutely. "Mrs. Jasher was
      accused by you, father&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only in a heated moment," cried the Professor, excusing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, she was accused," retorted Lucy stubbornly, "and now this
      sailor accuses Sir Frank. Who knows who will be charged next with
      committing the crime? I shall ask Archie to take the matter up, and hunt
      down the real criminal. Until the guilty person is found, I foresee that
      we shall never have a moment's peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite agree with you," said Mrs. Jasher earnestly. "For my own sake I
      wish the matter of this mystery to be cleared up. Why don't you help me?"
      she added, turning to Braddock, who listened placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am helping," said Braddock quietly. "I intend to set Cockatoo on the
      trail at once. He shall take up his abode in the Sailor's Rest on some
      pretext, and no doubt will be able to find a clue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" cried the widow incredulously, "a savage like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cockatoo is much cleverer than the average white man," said Braddock
      dryly, "especially in following a trail. He, if any one, will learn the
      truth. I would much rather trust the Kanaka than young Hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" cried Lucy, standing up for her lover. "Archie is the one to
      discover the assassin. I'll see him at once. And you, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, my dear," said the Professor calmly, "shall remain here and make my
      peace with the future Mrs. Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have made it already," said the widow graciously, and extended her
      hand, which the Professor kissed unexpectedly, and then sat back in his
      chair, looking quite abashed at his outburst of gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that everything was going well, Lucy left the elderly couple to
      continue their courting, and hurried to Archie's lodgings in the village.
      However, he happened to be out, and his landlady did not know when he
      would return. Rather annoyed by this, since she greatly desired to unbosom
      herself, Miss Kendal walked disconsolately towards the Pyramids. On the
      way she was stopped by Widow Anne, looking more dismal and funereal than
      ever, and garrulous with copious draughts of gin. Not that she was
      intoxicated, but her tongue was loose, and she wept freely for no apparent
      reason. According to herself, she had stopped Lucy to demand back from Mr.
      Hope through the girl certain articles of attire which had been borrowed
      for artistic purposes. These, consisting of a shawl and a skirt and a
      bodice, were of extraordinary value, and Mrs. Bolton wanted them back or
      their equivalent in value. She mentioned that she would prefer the sum of
      five pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you not ask Mr. Hope yourself?" said Lucy who was too impatient to
      bear with the old creature's maunderings. "If you gave him the things he
      will no doubt return them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they aren't spiled with paint," wailed Widow Anne. "He told my Sid as
      he wanted them for a model to wear while being painted. Sid asked me, and
      I gave 'em to Sid, and Sid, he passed 'em along to your good gentleman.
      There was a skirt, as good as new, and a body of the dress trimmest
      beautiful, and a tartan shawl as I got from my mother. But no," the old
      woman corrected herself, "it was a dark shawl with red spots and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask Mr. Hope, ask Mr. Hope," cried Miss Kendal impatiently. "I know
      nothing about the things," and she tore her dress from Widow Anne's
      detaining hand to hurry home. Mrs. Bolton wailed aloud at this desertion,
      and took her way to Hope's lodgings, where she declared her determination
      to remain until the artist restored her apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy for the moment thought little of this interview; but on reflection
      she thought it strange that Archie should borrow clothes from Mrs. Bolton
      through Sidney. Not that there was anything strange in Archie's procuring
      such garments, since he may have wanted them to clothe a model with. But
      he could easily have got such things from his landlady, or, if from Widow
      Anne, could have borrowed them direct without appealing to Sidney. Why,
      then, had the dead man acted as an intermediate party? This question was
      hard to answer, yet Lucy greatly wished for a reply, since she suddenly
      remembered how a woman in a dark dress and with a dark shawl over her head
      had been seen by Eliza Flight, the housemaid of the Sailor's Rest, talking
      to Bolton through the window. Were the garments borrowed as a disguise,
      and did the person who had borrowed them desire that it should be supposed
      that Widow Anne was talking to her son? There was a chill hand clutching
      Lucy's heart as she went home, for the words of Mrs. Bolton seemed
      indirectly to implicate Hope in the mystery. She determined to ask him
      about the matter straight out, when he came in that night to pay his usual
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner the Professor was in excellent spirits, and actually became so
      human as to compliment Lucy on her housekeeping. He also mentioned that he
      hoped Mrs. Jasher would cater as excellently. Over coffee he informed his
      step-daughter that he had entirely won the widow's heart by abasing
      himself at her feet and withdrawing the accusation. They had arranged to
      be married in May, one or two weeks after Lucy became Mrs. Hope. In the
      autumn they would start for Egypt, and would remain abroad for a year or
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," said the Professor, setting down his cup and preparing to take
      his departure, "everything is now settled excellently. I marry Mrs.
      Jasher: you, my dear, marry Hope, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Sir Frank marries Donna Inez," finished Lucy quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," said Braddock stiffly, "entirely depends upon what De Gayangos
      says to this accusation of Hervey's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Frank is innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, and I believe so. But he will have to prove his innocence. I
      shall do my best, and I have sent round to Don Pedro to come here. We can
      then talk it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can Archie and I come in also?" asked Miss Kendal anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat to her surprise, the Professor yielded a ready assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all means, my dear. The more witnesses we have, the better it will be.
      We must do all in our powers to bring this matter to a successful issue."
    </p>
    <p>
      So things were arranged, and when Archie came up to the drawing-room, Lucy
      informed him that Braddock was in the museum with Don Pedro, telling all
      that had happened. Hope was glad to hear that Lucy had secured the
      Professor's consent that they should be present, for the mystery of
      Bolton's terrible death was piquing him, and he dearly desired to learn
      the truth. As a matter of fact, although he was unaware of it, he was
      suffering from an attack of detective fever, and wished to solve the
      mystery. He therefore went gladly into the museum with his sweetheart.
      Oddly enough&mdash;as Lucy recollected when it was too late to speak&mdash;she
      quite forgot to relate what Widow Anne had said about the borrowed
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro, looking more stiff and dignified than ever, was in the museum
      with Braddock. The two men were seated in comfortable chairs, and
      Cockatoo, some distance away, was polishing with a cloth the green mummy
      case of the fatal object which had brought about all the trouble. Lucy had
      half expected to see Donna Inez, but De Gayangos explained that he had
      left her writing letters to Lima in the Warrior Inn. When Miss Kendal and
      Hope were seated, the Peruvian expressed himself much surprised at the
      charge which had been brought against Sir Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I can speak of such things in the presence of a lady," he remarked,
      bowing his head to Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes," she answered eagerly. "I have heard all about the charge. And I
      am glad that you are here, Don Pedro, for I wish to say that I do not
      believe there is a word of truth in the accusation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor do I," asserted the Peruvian decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree&mdash;I agree," cried Braddock, beaming. "And you, Hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never believed it, even before I heard Random's defense," said Archie
      with a dry smile. "Did you not see Captain Hervey yourself, sir?" he
      added, turning to Don Pedro; "he started for Pierside to look you up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not seen him," said De Gayangos in his stately way, "and I am very
      sorry, as I desire to examine him about the accusation he had dared to
      bring against my very good friend, Sir Frank Random. I wish he were here
      at this very minute, so that I could tell him what I think of the charge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Don Pedro spoke the unexpected happened, as though some genie had
      obeyed his commands. As though transported into the room by magic, the
      American skipper appeared, not through the floor, but by the door. A
      female domestic admitted him and announced his name, then fled to avoid
      the anger of her master, seeing she had violated the sacred precincts of
      the museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hervey, amused by the surprise visible on every face, sauntered
      forward, hat on head and cheroot in mouth as usual. But when he saw Lucy
      he removed both with a politeness scarcely to be expected from so rude and
      ready and rough a mariner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg pardon for coming here uninvited," said Hervey awkwardly, "but I've
      been chasing the Don all over Pierside and through this village. They told
      me at the police office that you"&mdash;he spoke to De Gayangos "had
      doubled on your trail, so here I am for a little private conversation."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Peruvian looked gravely at Hervey's face, which was clearly revealed
      in the powerful light of the many lamps with which the museum was filled,
      and rose to bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to see you, sir," he said politely, and with a still more
      searching glance. "With the permission of our host I shall ask you to take
      a chair," and he turned to Braddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly! certainly!" said the Professor fussily. "Cockatoo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon, allow me," said De Gayangos, and brought forward a chair, still
      keeping his eyes on the skipper, who was rather confused by the courtesy.
      "Will you be seated, senor: then we can talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey sat down quietly close to the Peruvian; who then leaned forward to
      address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have a cigarette?" he asked, offering a silver case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, no. I'll smoke a cheroot if the lady don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," replied Lucy, who, along with Archie and the Professor, was
      puzzled by Don Pedro's manner. "Please smoke!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In taking back the case Don Pedro allowed it to drop. As he made no motion
      of picking it up, Hervey, although annoyed with himself for his politeness
      towards a yellow-stomach, as he called De Gayangos, was compelled to
      stretch for it. As he handed it back to Don Pedro, the Peruvian's eyes
      lighted up and he nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Vasa," said De Gayangos, and Hervey, changing color, leaped
      from his seat as though touched by a spear-point.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. NEARER THE TRUTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a few moments there was silence. Lucy and Archie sat still, as they
      were too much surprised by Don Pedro's recognition of Captain Hervey as
      the Swedish sailor Vasa to move or speak. But the Professor did not seem
      to be greatly astonished, and the sole sound which broke the stillness was
      his sardonic chuckle. Perhaps the little man had progressed beyond the
      point of being surprised at anything, or, like, Moliere's hero, was only
      surprised at finding virtue in unexpected places.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Peruvian and the skipper, they were both on their feet, eyeing
      one another like two fighting dogs. Hervey was the first to find his very
      useful tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess you've got the bulge on me," said he, trying to outstare the
      Peruvian, for which nationality, from long voyaging on the South American
      coast, he entertained the most profound contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in De Gayangos he found a foeman worthy of his steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not," said Don Pedro quietly, and facing the pseudo-American
      bravely. "I never forget faces, and yours is a noticeable one. When you
      first spoke I fancied that I remembered your voice. All that business with
      the chair was to get close to you, so that I could see the scar on your
      right temple. It is still there, I notice. Also, I dropped my cigarette
      case and forced you to pick it up, so that, when you stretched your arm, I
      might see what mark was on your left wrist. It is a serpent encircling the
      sun, which Lola Farjados induced you to have tattooed when you were in
      Lima thirty years ago. Your eyes are blue and full of light, and as you
      were twenty when I knew you, the lapse of years has made you fifty&mdash;your
      present age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shucks!" said Hervey coolly, and sat down to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro turned to Archie and Braddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hope! Professor!" he remarked, "if you remember the description I
      gave of Gustav Vasa, I appeal to you to see if it does not exactly fit
      this man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does," said Archie unhesitatingly, "although I cannot see the tattooed
      left wrist to which you refer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey, still smoking, made no offer to show the symbol, but Braddock
      unexpectedly came to the assistance of Don Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man is Vasa right enough," he remarked abruptly. "Whether he is
      Swedish or American I cannot say. But he is the same man I met when I was
      in Lima thirty years ago, after the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey slowly turned his blue eyes on the scientist with a twinkle in
      their depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you recognized me?" he observed, with his Yankee drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recognized you at the moment I hired you to take The Diver to Malta to
      bring back that mummy," retorted Braddock, "but it didn't suit my book to
      let on. Didn't you recognize me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, no," said Hervey, his drawl more pronounced than ever. "I haven't
      got the memory for faces that you and the Don here seem to possess. Huh!"
      He wheeled his chair and faced Braddock squarely. "I'd have thought you
      wiser not to back up the Don, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock's little eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not afraid of you," said he with great contempt. "I never did
      anything for which you could get money out of me for, Captain Hervey or
      Gustav Vasa, or whatever your name might be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were always a mighty spry man," assented the skipper coolly, "but
      spry men, I take it, make mistakes from being too almighty smart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock shrugged his shoulders, and Don Pedro intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is all beside the point," he remarked angrily. "Captain Hervey, do
      you deny that you are Gustav Vasa in the face of this evidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey drew up the left sleeve of his reefer jacket, and showed on his
      bared wrist the symbol of the sun and the encircling serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that enough?" he drawled, "or do you want to look at this?" and he
      turned his head to reveal his scarred right temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you admit that you are Vasa?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal," drawled the captain again, "that's one of my names, I guess, though
      I haven't used it since I traded that blamed mummy in Paris, thirty years
      ago. There's nothing like owning up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not Swedish?" asked Lucy timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a citizen of the world, I guess," replied Hervey with great
      politeness for him, "and America suits me for headquarters as well as any
      other nation. I might be Swedish or Danish or a Dago for choice. Vasa may
      be my name, or Hervey, or anything you like. But I guess I'm a man all
      through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a thief!" cried Don Pedro, who had resumed his seat, but was keeping
      quiet with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not of those emeralds," rejoined the skipper coolly: "Lord, to think of
      the chance I missed! Thirty years ago I could have looted them, and again
      the other day. But I never knew&mdash;I never knew," cried Hervey
      regretfully, with his vividly blue eyes on the mummy. "I could jes' kick
      myself, gentlemen, when I think of the miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you didn't steal the manuscript along with the emeralds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I did," cried Hervey, turning to Archie, who had spoken, "but it was
      in a furren lingo, to which I didn't catch on. If I'd known I'd have
      learned about those blamed emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do with the copy of the manuscript you stole?" asked Don
      Pedro sharply. "I know there was a copy, as my father told me so. I have
      the original myself, but the transcript&mdash;and not a translation, as I
      fancied&mdash;appeared in Sir Frank Random's room to-day, hidden behind
      some books."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey made no move, but smoked steadily, with his eyes on the carpet.
      However, Archie, who was observing keenly, saw that he was more startled
      than he would admit. The explanation had taken him by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain!" cried the Peruvian sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey looked up and fixed a pair of very evil eyes on the Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here," he remarked, "if the lady wasn't present, I'd show you that I
      take no orders from any yellow&mdash;that is, from any low-down Don."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucy, my dear, leave us," said Braddock, rising, much excited; "we must
      have this matter sifted to the bottom, and if Hervey can explain better in
      your absence, I think you should go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Miss Kendal was very anxious to hear all that was to be heard,
      she saw the advisability of taking this advice, especially as Hope gave
      her arm a meaning nudge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go," she said meekly, and was escorted by her lover to the door.
      There she paused. "Tell me all that takes place," she whispered, and when
      Archie nodded, she vanished promptly. The young man closed the door and
      returned to his seat in time to hear Don Pedro reiterate his request for
      an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And 'spose I can't oblige," said the skipper, now more at his ease since
      the lady was out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall have you arrested," was the quick reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the theft of my mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey laughed raucously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess the law can't worry me about that after thirty years, and in a
      low-down country like Peru. Your Government has shifted fifty times since
      I looted the corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was quite true, and there was absolutely no chance of the skipper
      being brought to book. Don Pedro looked rather disconsolate, and his gaze
      dropped under the glare of Hervey's eyes, which seemed unfair, seeing that
      the Don was as good as the captain was evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't expect me to condone the theft," he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon I don't expect anything," retorted Hervey coolly "I looted the
      corpse, I don't deny, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After my father had treated you like a son," said Don Pedro bitterly.
      "You were homeless and friendless, and my father took you in, only to find
      that you robbed him of his most precious possession."
    </p>
    <p>
      The skipper had the grace to blush, and shifted uneasily in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't say truer than that," he grumbled, averting his eyes. "I guess
      I'm a bad lot all through. But a friend of mine wanted the corpse, and
      offered me a heap of dollars to see the business through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say that some one asked you to steal it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," put in Braddock unexpectedly, "for I was the friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" Don Pedro swung round in great astonishment, but the Professor
      faced him with all the consciousness of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he remarked quietly, "as I told you, I was in Peru thirty years
      ago. I was then hunting for specimens of Inca mummies. Vasa&mdash;this man
      now called Hervey&mdash;told me that he could obtain a splendid specimen
      of a mummy, and I arranged to give him one hundred pounds to procure what
      I wanted. But I swear to you, De Gayangos," continued the little man
      earnestly, "that I did not know he proposed to steal the mummy from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew it was the green mummy?" asked Don Pedro sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I only knew that it was a mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Vasa get it for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess not," said the gentleman who confessed to that name. "The
      Professor went to Cuzco and got into trouble&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was carried off to the mountains by some Indians," interpolated the
      Professor, "and only escaped after a year's captivity. I did not mind
      that, as it gave me the opportunity of studying a decaying civilization.
      But when I returned a free man to Lima, I found that Vasa had left the
      country with the mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," assented Hervey, waving his hand. "I got a berth as second
      mate on a wind-jammer sailing to Europe, and as the country wasn't healthy
      for me since I'd looted the green mummy, I took it abroad and yanked it to
      Paris, where I sold it for a couple of hundred pounds. With that, I
      changed my name and had a high old time. I never heard of the blamed thing
      again until the Professor here turned up with Mr. Bolton at Pierside,
      asking me to bring it in The Diver from Malta. It was what you'd call a
      coincidence, I reckon," added Hervey lazily; "but I did cry small when I
      heard the Professor here had paid nine hundred for a thing I'd let slip
      for two hundred. Had I known of those infernal emeralds, I'd have ripped
      open the case on board and would have recouped myself. But I knew nothing,
      and Bolton never told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could he," asked Braddock quietly, "when he did not know that any
      jewels were buried with the dead? I did not know either. And I have
      explained why I wanted the mummy. But it never struck me until I hear what
      you say now, that this mummy," he nodded towards the green case, "was the
      one which you had stolen at Lima from De Gayangos. But you must do me the
      justice, Captain Hervey, to tell Don Pedro that I never countenanced the
      theft."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! you were square enough, I guess. The sin is on my own blessed
      shoulders, and I don't ask it to be shifted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do with the copy of the manuscript?" asked Don Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey ruminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't think," he mused. "I found a screed of Latin along with the
      mummy, when I looted it from your Lima house, but it dropped out of my
      mind as to what became of it. Maybe I passed it along to the Paris man,
      and he sold it along with the corpse to the Maltese gent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I tell you this copy was found in Sir Frank's room," insisted De
      Gayangos. "How did it come to be there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hervey rose and took a turn up and down the room. When Cockatoo
      came in his way he calmly kicked him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think, Mr. Hope?" he asked, coming to a full stop before
      Archie, while Cockatoo crept away with a very dark scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to think," replied that young gentleman promptly, "save
      that Sir Frank is my very good friend, and that I take his word that he
      knows nothing of how the manuscript came to be hidden in his bookcase."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh!" said Hervey scornfully, and took another turn up and down the room
      in silence. "I surmise that your friend isn't a white man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope leaped to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a lie," he said distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd have shot you for that down Chili way," snapped the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly," retorted the artist dryly, "but I happen to be handy with my
      revolver also. I say again that you lie. Random is not the man to commit
      so foul a crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how did the manuscript get into his room?" questioned Hervey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is trying to learn, and, when he does, will come here to let us all
      know, Captain Hervey. But I ask you on what grounds you accuse him? Oh I
      know all you said to-day," added Hope scornfully, waving his hand; "but
      you can't prove that Random got the manuscript."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's in his room, as you acknowledge, I can," said Hervey, speaking in
      a much more cultivated tone. "See here. As I said before, that copy must
      have been passed along with the corpse to the Maltese man. Well, then, the
      Professor here bought the corpse, and with it the manuscript."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," contradicted the little man, prodigiously excited. "Bolton wrote to
      me full particulars of the mummy, but said nothing about any manuscript."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he wouldn't," replied Hervey calmly, "seeing that he'd know Latin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did know Latin," admitted Braddock uneasily; "I taught him myself. But
      do you mean to say that he got that manuscript and read it and intended to
      keep the fact of the emeralds secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey nodded three times, and twisted his cheroot in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How else can you figure the business out?" he demanded quietly, and with
      his eyes fixed on the excited Professor. "Bolton must have got that
      manuscript, as I can't remember what I did with it, save pass it along
      with the corpse. He&mdash;as you admit&mdash;doesn't tell you about it
      when he writes. Well, then, I reckon he calculated getting this corpse to
      England, and intended to steal the emeralds when safely ashore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he could have done that on the boat," said Archie quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess not, with me about," said Hervey coolly. "I'd have spotted his
      game and would have howled for shares."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dare to say that?" demanded De Gayangos fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your hair on. I dare to say anything that comes up my darned back,
      you bet. I'm not going to knuckle down to a yellow-stomach&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Out flew Don Pedro's long arm, and Hervey slammed against the wall. He
      slipped his hand around to his hip pocket with an ugly smile, but before
      he could use the revolver he produced, Hope dashed up his arm, and the
      ball went through the ceiling. "Lucy!" cried the young man, knowing that
      the drawing-room was overhead, and in a moment was out of the door, racing
      up the stairs at top speed. Some sense of shame seemed to overpower Hervey
      as he thought that he might have shot the girl, and he replaced the
      revolver in his pocket with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I climb down and apologize," he said to Don Pedro, who bowed gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang you, sir; you might have shot my daughter," cried Braddock. "The
      drawing-room, where she is sitting, is right overhead, and-"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the door opened, and Lucy came in on Archie's arm. She was
      pale with fright, but had sustained no damage. It seemed that the revolver
      bullet had passed through the floor some distance away from where she was
      sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I offer my humble apologies, miss," said the cowed Hervey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll break your neck, you ruffian!" growled Hope, who looked, and was,
      dangerous. "How dare you shoot here and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right," interposed Lucy, not wishing for further trouble. "I am
      all safe. But I shall remain here for the rest of your interview, Captain
      Hervey, as I am sure you will not shoot again in the presence of a lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss," muttered the captain, and when again invited by the angry
      Professor to speak, resumed his discourse in low tones. "Wal, as I was
      saying," he remarked, sitting down with a dogged look, "Bolton intended to
      clear with the emeralds, but I guess Sir Frank got ahead of him and packed
      him in that blamed case, while he annexed the emeralds. He then took the
      manuscript, which he looted from Bolton's corpse, and hid it among his
      books, as you say, while he left the blamed mummy in the garden of the old
      lady you talked about. I guess that's what I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all theory," said Don Pedro in vexed tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there isn't a word of truth in it," said Lucy indignantly, standing
      up for Frank Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ain't for me to contradict you, miss," said Hervey, who was still
      humble, "but I ask you, if what I say ain't true, how did that copy of the
      manuscript come to be in that aristocrat's room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply made to this, and although every one present, save
      Hervey, believed in Random's innocence, no one could explain. The reply
      came after some further conversation, by the appearance of the soldier
      himself in mess kit. He walked unexpectedly into the room with Donna Inez
      on his arm, and at once apologized to De Gayangos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I called to see you at the inn, sir," he said, "and as you were not
      there, I brought your daughter along with me to explain about the
      manuscript."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes. We talk of that now. How did it come into your room, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Random pointed to Hervey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That rascal placed it there," he said firmly.

      CHAPTER XX. THE LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this second insult Archie quite expected to see the skipper again draw
      his revolver and shoot. He therefore jumped up rapidly to once more avert
      disaster. But perhaps the fiery American was awed by the presence of a
      second lady&mdash;since men of the adventurous type are often shy when the
      fair sex is at hand&mdash;for he meekly sat where he was and did not even
      contradict. Don Pedro shook hands with Sir Frank, and then Hervey smiled
      blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you don't believe in my theory," said he scoffingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What theory is that?" asked Random hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hervey declares that you murdered Bolton, stole the manuscript from him,
      and concealed it in your room," said Archie succinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't suggest any other reason for its presence in the room," observed
      the American with a grim smile. "If I'm wrong, perhaps this almighty
      aristocrat will correct me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random was about to do so, and with some pardonable heat, when he was
      anticipated by Donna Inez. It has been mentioned before that this young
      lady was of the silent order. Usually she simply ornamented any company in
      which she found herself without troubling to entertain with her tongue.
      But the accusation against the baronet, whom she apparently loved, changed
      her into a voluble virago. Brushing aside the little Professor, who stood
      in her way, she launched herself forward and spoke at length. Hervey,
      cowering in the chair, thus met with an antagonist against whom he had no
      armor. He could not use force; she dominated him with her eye and when he
      ventured to open his mouth his few feeble words were speedily drowned by
      the torrent of speech which flowed from the lips of the Peruvian lady.
      Every one was as astonished by this outburst as though a dog had spoken.
      That the hitherto silent Donna Inez de Gayangos should speak thus freely
      and with such power was quite as great a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;are a dog and a liar," said Donna Inez with great distinctness,
      and speaking English excellently. "What you say against Sir Frank is
      madness and foolish talk. In Genoa my father did not speak of the
      manuscript, nor did I, who tell you this. How, then, could Sir Frank kill
      this poor man, when he had no reason to slay him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the emeralds," faltered Hervey weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the emeralds!" echoed the lady scornfully. "Sir Frank is rich. He
      does not need to steal to have much money. He is a gentleman, who does not
      murder, as you have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey started to his feet, dismayed but defiant, and saw that he was
      ringed with unfriendly faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I have done. Why, I am&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Inez interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a murderer. I truly believe that you&mdash;yes, that you" she
      pointed a scornful finger at him "killed this poor man who was bringing
      the mummy to the Professor. If you were in my own country, I should have
      you lashed like the dog you are. Pig of a Yankee, vile scum of the&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do, Inez," said De Gayangos imperiously. "We wish to make this
      gentleman tell the truth, and this is not the way to go about the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentleman," echoed the angry Peruvian, "he is none. Truth! There is no
      truth in him, the pig of pigs!" and then, her English failing, she took
      refuge in Spanish, which is a fairly comprehensive language for swearing
      in a polite way. The words fairly poured from her mouth, and she looked as
      fierce as Bellona, the goddess of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie, listening to her words and watching her beautiful face distorted
      out of all loveliness, secretly congratulated himself upon the fact that
      he was not her prospective bridegroom. He wondered how Sir Frank, who was
      a mild, good-tempered man himself, could dare to make such a fiery female
      Lady Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the young man thought himself that she was going a trifle too far,
      for he touched her nervously on the arm. At once the anger of Donna Inez
      died down, and she submitted to be led to a chair, whispering as she went,
      "It was for your sake, my angel, that I was angry," she said, and then
      relapsed into silence, watching all future proceedings with flashing eyes
      but compressed mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal," muttered Hervey with his invariable drawl, "now that the lady has
      eased her mind, I should like to know why this aristocrat says I placed
      that manuscript in his room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall know, and at once," said Random promptly. "Did you not call to
      see me a day or so ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, sir. I wished to tell you what I had discovered, so that you might
      pay me to shut my mouth if you felt so inclined. I asked where your room
      was, sir, and walked right in, since your flunky was not at the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so. You were in my room for a few minutes&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say five," interpolated the American imperturbably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then came down. You met my servant, who told you that I would not be
      back for five or six hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just as you state, sir. I was sorry to miss you, but, my time
      being valuable, I had to get back to Pierside. Failing you, I later came
      to see the Professor here, and told him what I had discovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You merely discovered a mare's nest," said Random contemptuously; "but
      this is not the point. I believe that you, and you only, could have hidden
      that manuscript among my books, intending that it should be discovered, so
      that I might be implicated in this crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did your flunky tell you that much?" inquired Hervey coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My servant told me nothing, save that you had been in my room, where you
      had no right to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said the American quietly and decisively, "I can't see, sir, how
      you can place the ticket on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You accuse me, so why should I not accuse you?" retorted Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you are guilty, and I ain't," snapped the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You join issue: you join issue," murmured Braddock, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random took no notice of the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard from Mr. Hope and Professor Braddock of the grounds upon
      which you base your accusation, and I have explained to them how I came to
      be on board your ship and both in and out of the Sailor's Rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the explanation is quite satisfactory," said Hope smartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree," Donna Inez nodded with very bright eyes. "Sir Frank has
      explained to me also. He knew nothing of the manuscript."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, sir," said Don Pedro quietly to Captain Hervey, "apparently did,
      since you stole it along with the mummy from Lima."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess the theft, but I didn't know what the manuscript contained,"
      said the skipper dryly, "or I reckon you wouldn't have to ask who stole
      the emeralds. No, sir, I should have looted them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you did, and murdered Bolton," cried Random hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shucks!" retorted Hervey, rising with a shrug, "if I had wished to get
      rid of Bolton, I'd have yanked him overboard and then would have written
      `accident' in my blamed log-book."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock looked at Don Pedro, and Archie at Sir Frank. What the skipper
      said was plausible enough. No man would have been such a fool as to have
      murdered Bolton ashore, when he could have done so without suspicion on
      board the tramp. Moreover, Hervey spoke with genuine regret, since he had
      missed the emeralds and assuredly would not have hesitated to steal them
      even at the cost of Bolton's life, had he known of their whereabouts. So
      far he had made a good defense, and, seeing the impression produced, he
      strolled to the door. There he halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you gents want to lynch me," he said leisurely, "I'll be found at the
      Sailor's Rest for the next week. Then I'm going as skipper of The Firefly
      steamer, Port o' London, to Algiers. You can send the sheriff along
      whenever you choose. But I mean to have my picnic first, and to-morrow I'm
      going to Inspector Date with my yarn. Then I guess that almighty
      aristocrat wilt find himself in quod."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment," cried Braddock, running to the door. "Let me talk to you
      and arrange what is best to be done. If you will&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded no further, for without vouchsafing him a reply, Hervey, now
      quite master of the situation, passed through the door, and the Professor
      hastily followed him. Those who remained looked at one another, scarcely
      knowing what to say, or how to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will arrest thee, my angel," cried Donna Inez, clasping Random's
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them," retorted the young man defiantly. "They can prove nothing.
      With all my heart and soul I believe Hervey to be the guilty person. Hope,
      what do you say?&mdash;and you, Miss Kendal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hervey has certainly made an excellent defense," said Archie cautiously.
      "He wouldn't have been such a fool as to murder Bolton ashore when he
      could have done it so easily when on the narrow seas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree with you there," said Random quickly. "But if he is innocent; if
      he did not bring the manuscript into my room, who did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if Widow Anne herself is guilty?" said Lucy in a musing tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      All present turned and looked at the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is Widow Anne?" asked Don Pedro with a puzzled air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is the mother of Sidney Bolton, the man who was murdered," said Hope
      quickly. "My dear Lucy, why do you say that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy paused before replying and then answered the question by asking
      another one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ask Sidney to get you some clothes from his mother to clothe a
      model?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never in my life," said Hope promptly, and, as Lucy, saw, truly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I accidentally met Mrs. Bolton to-day, and she insisted that her
      son had borrowed from her a dark shawl and a dark dress for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not true," said Hope hotly. "Why should the woman tell such a
      lie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Lucy slowly, "it struck me that the woman who spoke with
      Sidney through the Sailor's Rest window might be Widow Anne herself, and
      that she has invented this story of the clothes being lent to account for
      their being worn, should she be discovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's certainly odd she should speak like this," said Random thoughtfully;
      "but you forget, Miss Kendal, that she proved an alibi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of that?" cried Don Pedro hurriedly, "alibis can be manufactured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be best to see this woman and question her," suggested Donna
      Inez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do so to-morrow. By the way, does she ever come to your room in
      the Fort, Random?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, she is my laundress, you know, and at times brings back the
      clothes herself. My servant is usually in, though. I see what you mean.
      That she might have received the manuscript from Bolton, and have left it
      in my room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think that," said Archie slowly. "I should not be at all surprised
      to learn that a portion of Hervey's theory is correct. Bolton may have
      found the manuscript packed up in the mummy, amongst the graveclothes, in
      fact. If he read it&mdash;as he would and could, seeing that he was an
      excellent Latin scholar, thanks to Professor Braddock's training&mdash;he
      might have formed a design to steal the emeralds when he was in the
      Sailor's Rest. Then someone saved him the trouble, and packed him off to
      Gartley instead of the mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should Widow Anne leave the manuscript in my room?" argued
      Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you see? Bolton knew that you wanted the mummy for Don Pedro, and
      was aware how you had&mdash;so to speak&mdash;used threats in the presence
      of witnesses, since you spoke out aloud on the deck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only to warn Bolton against the Indians," pleaded Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly; but your words were capable of being twisted as Hervey has
      twisted them. Well, if Widow Anne really went to see her son&mdash;and
      from the lie about the borrowed clothes it looks like it&mdash;he may have
      given her the manuscript, so as to throw the blame on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The murder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Archie testily. "Bolton did not expect to be murdered. But
      I really believe that he intended to fly with the emeralds, and hoped that
      when the manuscript was found in your room you would be accused. The idea
      was suggested to him, I believe, by your visit to The Diver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think, Miss Kendal?" asked Random nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy that it is possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Frank turned to the Peruvian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro," he said proudly, "you have heard what Hervey says; do you
      believe that I am guilty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer De Gayangos took his daughter's hand and placed it in that of
      the young soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will show you what I think," he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Random, moved, and shook his future father-in-law
      heartily by the hand, while Donna Inez, throwing all restraint to the
      winds, kissed her lover exultingly on the check. In the midst of this
      scene Professor Braddock returned, looking very pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have induced Hervey to hold his tongue for a few days until we can look
      into this matter," he said, rubbing his hands "that is, if you think it
      wise, all of you. Otherwise, I am quite willing to go myself to-morrow and
      tell the police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Archie rapidly, "let us thresh out the matter ourselves. We
      will save Sir Frank's name from a police court slur at all events."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think there is any chance of Sir Frank being arrested," said Don
      Pedro politely; "the evidence is insufficient. And at the worst he can
      provide an alibi."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not so sure of that," said Random anxiously. "I went to London
      certainly, but I did not go to any place where I am known. However," he
      added cheerfully, "I daresay I'll be able to defend myself. Still, the
      fact remains that we are no nearer to learning who killed Bolton than we
      were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sending Cockatoo to Pierside to-morrow to stop at the Sailor's Rest
      for a time," said Braddock quickly. "He will watch Hervey, and if there is
      anything suspicious about his movements, we shall soon know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I turn amateur detective to-morrow and question Widow Anne," said
      Hope, after which remark he had to explain matters to Braddock, who had
      been out of the room when Mrs. Bolton's strange request had been
      discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Donna Inez had been whispering to her lover and pointing to the
      mummy. Don Pedro followed her thoughts and guessed what she was saying.
      Random proved the truth of his guess by, turning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really want to take back the mummy to Peru, sir?" he asked
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Inca Caxas was my forefather. I do not wish to leave him in
      this place. His body must be restored to its tomb. All the Indians, who
      look upon me as their present Inca expect me to bring the body back.
      Although," added De Gayangos gravely, "I did not come to Europe to look
      for the mummy, as you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall buy the mummy," said Random impetuously. "Professor, will
      you sell it to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that I have examined it thoroughly I shall be delighted," said the
      little man, "say for two thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," interposed Don Pedro; "you mean one thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he does," said Lucy quickly; "and the check must be paid to
      Archie, Sir Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me! to me!" cried Braddock indignantly. "I insist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The money belongs to Archie," said Lucy obstinately. "You have seen what
      you desired to see, father and as Archie only lent you the money, it is
      only fair that he should have it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let the Professor have it," said Hope good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Random laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall make the check payable to you, Miss Kendal, and you can give it
      to whomsoever you choose," he said; "and now, as everything has been
      settled so far, I suggest that we should retire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to my rooms at the inn," said Don Pedro, opening the door. "I have
      much to say to you. Good night, Professor; to-morrow let us go to Pierside
      and see if we cannot get at the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to-morrow," cried Random, "I shall send the check, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the company departed, Lucy had another wrangle with her father about
      the check. As Archie had gone away, she could speak freely, and pointed
      out that he was enjoying her mother's income and was about to marry Mrs.
      Jasher, who was rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore," argued Lucy, "you certainly do not want to keep poor Archie's
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He paid me that sum on condition that I consented to the wedding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did nothing of the sort," she cried indignantly. "I am not going to be
      bought and sold in this manner. Archie lent you the money, and it must be
      returned. Don't force me to think you selfish, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of the argument was that Lucy got her own way, and the
      Professor rather unwillingly agreed to part with the mummy and restore the
      thousand pounds. But he regretted doing so, as he wished to get all the
      money he could to go towards his proposed Egyptian expedition, and Mrs.
      Jasher's fortune, as he assured his step-daughter, was not so large as
      might be thought. However, Lucy overruled him, and retired to bed,
      congratulating herself that she would soon be able to marry Hope. She was
      beginning to grow a trifle weary of the Professor's selfish nature, and
      wondered how her mother had put up with it for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Braddock did not go with Don Pedro to Pierside, as he was very
      busy in his museum. The Peruvian went alone, and Archie, after a morning's
      work at his easel, sought out Widow Anne to ask questions. Lucy and Donna
      Inez paid an afternoon visit to Mrs. Jasher and found her in bed, as she
      had caught a mild sort of influenza. They expected to find Sir Frank here,
      but it seemed that he had not called. Thinking that he was detained by
      military business, the girls thought nothing more of his absence, although
      Donna Inez was somewhat downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Random was detained in his quarters by a letter which had arrived by
      the mid-day host, and which surprised him not a little. The postmark was
      London, and the writing, evidently a disguised hand, was almost illegible
      in its crudeness. The contents ran as follows, and it will be noticed that
      there is neither date nor address, and that it is written in the third
      person:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Sir Frank Random wants his character to be cleared and all suspicion
      of murder to be removed from him, he can be completely exonerated by the
      writer, if he will pay the same five thousand pounds. If Sir Frank Random
      is willing to do this, let him appoint a meeting-place in London, and the
      writer will send a messenger to receive the money and to hand over the
      proofs which will clear Sir Frank Random. If Sir Frank Random plays the
      writer false, or communicates with the police, proofs will be forthcoming
      which will prove him to be guilty of Sidney Bolton's death, and which will
      bring him to the scaffold without any chance of escape. A couple of lines
      in the Agony Column of The Daily Telegraph, signed `Artillery,' and
      appointing a meeting-place, will suffice; but beware of treachery."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. A STORY OF THE PAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher's influenza proved to be very mild indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Donna Inez de Gayangos and Lucy paid a visit to her on the afternoon
      of the day succeeding the explanations in the museum, she was certainly in
      bed, and explained that she had been there since the Professor's visit on
      the previous day. Lucy was surprised at this, as she had left Mrs. Jasher
      perfectly well, and Braddock had not mentioned any ailment of the widow.
      But influenza, as Mrs. Jasher observed, was very rapid in its action, and
      she was always susceptible to disease from the fact that in Jamaica she
      had suffered from malaria. Still, she was feeling better and intended to
      rise from her bed on that evening, if only to lie on the couch in the pink
      drawing-room. Having thus detailed her reasons for being ill, the widow
      asked for news.
    </p>
    <p>
      As no prohibition had been placed upon Lucy with regard to Hervey's visit
      and as Mrs. Jasher would be one of the family when she married the
      Professor, Miss Kendal had no hesitation in reporting all that had taken
      place. The narrative excited Mrs. Jasher, and she frequently interrupted
      with expressions of wonder. Even Donna Inez grew eloquent, and told the
      widow how she had defended Sir Frank against the American skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dreadfully wicked man!" said Mrs. Jasher, when in possession of
      all the facts. "I really believe that he did kill poor Sidney."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Lucy decisively, "I don't think that. He would have murdered
      him on board had he intended the crime, as he could have done so with more
      safety. He is as innocent as Sir Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no one dare say a word against him," cried Donna Inez with flashing
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has a good defender, my dear," said the widow, patting the girl's
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love him," said Donna Inez, as if that explained everything, and
      perhaps it did, so far as she was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher smiled indulgently, then turned for further information to
      Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can it be possible," she said, "that Widow Anne is guilty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't think so. She would not murder her own son, especially when
      she was so very fond of him. Archie told me, just before we came here,
      that he had called to see her. She still insists that Sidney borrowed the
      clothes, saying that Archie wanted them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you make of that, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Miss Kendal, pondering, "either Widow Anne herself was the
      woman who talked to Sidney through the Sailor's Rest window, and has
      invented this story to save herself, or Sidney did get the clothes and
      intended to use them as a disguise when he fled with the emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," said Mrs. Jasher, "the woman who talked through the window
      still remains a problem. Again, if Sidney Bolton intended to steal the
      emeralds, he could have done so in Malta, or on board the boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Lucy decisively. "The mummy was taken directly from the
      seller's house to the boat, and perhaps Sidney did not find the manuscript
      until he looked at the mummy. Then Captain Hervey kept an eye on Sidney,
      so that he could not open the mummy to steal the emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, according to your own showing, Sidney looked at the actual mummy&mdash;he
      opened the mummy case, that is, else he could not have got the
      manuscript."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so, but of course we cannot be sure. But the packing case in
      which the mummy was stowed was placed in the hold of the steamer, and if
      Sidney had wished to steal the emeralds, he could not have done so without
      exciting Captain Hervey's suspicions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let us say that Sidney robbed the mummy when in the Sailor's Rest,
      and took the clothes he borrowed from his mother in order to fly in
      disguise. But what of the woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell. We may learn more later. Don Pedro has gone to Pierside to
      search, and my father says that he will send Cockatoo there also to
      search."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," sighed Mrs. Jasher wearily, "I hope that all this trouble will
      come to an end. That green mummy has proved most unlucky. Leave me now,
      dear girls, as I feel somewhat tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye," said Lucy, kissing her. "I hope that you will be better this
      evening. Don't get up unless you feel quite able."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I shall take my ease in the drawing-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you always called it the parlor," laughed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," Mrs. Jasher smiled, "you see I am practicing against the time when I
      shall be mistress of the Pyramids, You can't call that large room there a
      parlor," and she laughed weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, Mrs. Jasher impressed both Lucy and Donna Inez with the fact
      that she was very weak and scarcely able, as she put it, to draw one leg
      after the other. Both the girls would have been surprised to see what a
      hearty meal Mrs. Jasher made that evening, when she was up and dressed.
      Perhaps she felt that her strength needed keeping up, but she certainly
      partook largely of the delicate dinner provided by Jane, who was a most
      excellent cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Mrs. Jasher lay on a pink couch in the pink parlor by a
      splendid fire, for the night was cold and raw with a promise of rain. The
      widow had a small table at her elbow, on which stood a cup of coffee and a
      glass of liquor. The rose-colored curtains were drawn, the rose-shaded
      lamps were lighted, and the whole interior of the cottage looked very
      comfortable indeed. Mrs. Jasher, in a crocus-yellow tea-gown trimmed with
      rich black lace, reclined on her couch like Cleopatra in her barge. In the
      pink light she looked very well preserved, although her face wore an
      anxious expression. This was due to the fact that the mail had come in and
      the three letters brought by the postman had to do with creditors. Mrs.
      Jasher was always trying to make both ends meet, and had a hard struggle
      to keep her head above water. Certainly, since she had inherited the money
      of her brother, the Pekin merchant, she need not have looked so worried.
      But she did, and made no disguise of it, seeing that she was quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time she went to her desk and took out a bundle of bills and some
      other letters, also an account book and a bank book. Over these she pored
      for quite an hour. The clock struck nine before she looked up from this
      unpleasant task, and she found her financial position anything but
      satisfactory. With a weary sigh she rose and stared at herself in the
      mirror over the fireplace, frowning as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless I can marry the Professor at once, I don't know what will happen
      to me," she mused gloomily. "I have managed very well so far, but things
      are coming to a crisis. These devils," she alluded to her creditors, "will
      not keep off much longer, and then the crash will come. I shall have to
      leave Gartley as poor as when I came, and there will be nothing left but
      the old nightmare life of despair and horror. I am getting older every
      day, and this is my last chance of getting married. I must force the
      Professor to have a speedy marriage. I must! I must!" and she began to
      pace the tiny room in a frenzy of terror and well-founded alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was trying to calm herself and succeeding very badly, Jane entered
      the room with a card. It proved to be that of Sir Frank Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rather a late hour for a visit," said Mrs. Jasher to the servant.
      "However, I feel so bored, that perhaps he will cheer me up. Ask him to
      come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jane left, she stood still for a moment or so, trying to think why
      the young man had called at so untoward an hour. But when his footsteps
      were heard approaching the door, she swept the books and the bills and the
      letters into the desk and locked it quickly. When Random appeared at the
      door, she was just leaving the desk to greet him, and no one would have
      taken the smiling, plump, well-preserved woman for the creature who lately
      had looked so haggard and careworn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to see you, Sir Frank," said Mrs. Jasher, nodding in a familiar
      manner. "Sit down in this very comfortable chair, and Jane shall bring you
      some coffee and kummel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you," said Random in his usual stiff way, but very politely. "I
      have just left the mess, where I had a good dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher nodded, and sank again on the couch, which was opposite the
      chair which she had selected for her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you are in mess kit," she said gayly; "quite a glorified creature
      to appear in my poor little parlor. Why are you not with Donna Inez? I
      have heard all about your engagement from Lucy. She was here to-day with
      Senorita De Gayangos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I believe," said Random, still stiffly; "but you see I was anxious to
      come and see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Mrs. Jasher equably, "you heard that I was ill. Yes; I have
      been in bed ever since yesterday afternoon, until a couple of hours ago.
      But I am now better. My dinner has done me good. Pass me that fan, please.
      The fire is so hot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Frank did as he was told, and she held the feather fan between her
      face and the fire, while he stared at her, wondering what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you find this atmosphere very stuffy?" he remarked at length. "It
      would be a good thing to have the windows open."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy, are you mad? I have a touch of the influenza, and an open
      window would bring about my death. Why, this room is delightfully
      comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is such a strong perfume about it," sniffed Random pointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think you knew that scent by this time, Sir Frank. I use no
      other and never have done. Smell!" and she passed a flimsy handkerchief of
      lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random took the handkerchief and placed it to his nostrils. As he did so a
      strange expression of triumph crept into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you told me once that it was a Chinese perfume," he said,
      returning the handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher nodded, well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I get it from a friend of my late husband who is in the British Embassy
      at Pekin. No one uses it but me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely some other person uses it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in England; and I do not know why you should say so. It is a
      specialty of mine. Why," she added playfully, "if you met me in the dark
      you should know me, by this scent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you swear that no one else has ever used this perfume?" asked Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher lifted her penciled eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know why you should ask me to swear," she said quietly, "but I
      assure you that I keep this perfume which comes from China to myself. Not
      even Lucy Kendal has it, although she greatly desired some. We women are
      selfish in some things, my dear man. It's a most delicious perfume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Sir Frank, staring at her, "and very strong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing. Only I should think that such a perfume would be good for the
      cold you contracted by going to London last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher turned suddenly pale under her rouge, and her hand clenched
      the fan so tightly as to break the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not been to London for quite a month," she faltered. "What a
      strange remark!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A true one," said the baronet, fumbling in the pocket of his jacket. "You
      went to London last night by the seven o'clock train to post this," and he
      held out the anonymous letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow, now quite pale, and looking years older, sat up on the couch
      with a painful effort, which suggested old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand," she said, trying to speak calmly. "I was not in
      London, and I did not post any letter. If you came here to insult me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There can be no insult in asking a few questions," said Random, throwing
      aside his stiffness and speaking decisively. "I received this letter,
      which bears a London postmark, by the mid-day post. The handwriting is
      disguised, and there is neither address nor signature nor date. You
      manufactured your communication very cleverly, Mrs. Jasher, but you forgot
      that the Chinese perfume might betray you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The perfume! the perfume!" Mrs. Jasher gasped and saw in a moment how the
      late conversation had led her to fall into a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letter retains traces of the perfume you use," went on the baronet
      relentlessly. "I have a remarkably keen sense of smell, and, as scent is a
      most powerful aid to memory, I speedily recollected that you used this
      especial perfume. You told me a few moments ago that no one else used it,
      and so you have proved the truth of my statement that this letter"&mdash;he
      tapped it&mdash;"is written by you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a lie&mdash;a mistake," stuttered Mrs. Jasher, now at bay and
      looking dangerous. Her society veneer was stripped off, and the
      adventuress pure and simple came to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indignant at the way in which she had deceived everyone, and having much
      at stake, Random did not spare her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not a mistake," he insisted; "neither is it a lie. When I became
      aware that you must have written the letter, I drove at once to Jessum to
      see if you had gone to London, as you had posted it there. I learned from
      the station master and from a porter that you went to town by the seven
      o'clock train and returned by the midnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher leaped to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They could not recognize me. I wore&mdash;" Then she stopped, confused at
      having so plainly betrayed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wore a veil. All the same, Mrs. Jasher, you are too well known
      hereabouts for anyone to fail to recognize you. Besides, your remark just
      now proves that I am right. You wrote this blackmailing letter, and I
      demand an explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have none to give," muttered the woman fiercely, and fighting every
      inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you refuse to explain to me you shall to the police," said Sir Frank,
      rising and making for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher flung herself forward and clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake, don't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will explain? You will tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who murdered Sidney Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know. I swear I do not know," she cried feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is ridiculous," said Random coldly. "You say in this letter that you
      can hang me or save me. As you know that I am innocent, you must be aware
      who is guilty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all bluff. I know nothing," said Mrs. Jasher, releasing his arm and
      throwing herself on the couch. "I only wished to get money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five thousand pounds&mdash;eh? Rather a large order," sneered Random,
      replacing the letter in his pocket. "You would not ask that sum for
      nothing: you must be aware of the truth. I suspected many people, Mrs.
      Jasher, but never you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman rose and flung out her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said in a deep voice, and fighting like a rat in a corner. "I
      tricked you all down here. Sir Frank, I will tell you the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the murder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing of that. About myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll hear about yourself first," he said. "I can learn details concerning
      the murder later. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing of the murder or of the theft of the emeralds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you hid the mummy in this house, and afterwards placed it in your
      arbor to be found by the Professor, for some reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing about that either," muttered Mrs. Jasher doggedly, and
      with very white lips. "That letter you have traced to me is all bluff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you admit having written it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said sullenly. "You know too much, and it is useless for me to
      deny the truth in the face of the evidence you bring against me. I would
      fight though," she added, raising her head like a snake its crest, "if I
      was not sick and tired of fighting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fighting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, against trouble and worry and money difficulties and creditors. Oh,"
      she struck her breast, "what do you know of life, you rich, easy-going
      man? I have been in the depths, and not through my own fault. I had a bad
      mother, a bad husband. I was dragged in the mire by those who should have
      helped me to rise. I have starved for days; I have wept for years; in all
      God's earth there is no more miserable a creature than I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kindly talk without so much melodrama," said Random cruelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," Mrs. Jasher sat down and locked her hands together, "you don't
      believe me. I daresay you don't understand, for life, real life, is a
      sealed book to you. It is useless for me to appeal to your sympathy, for
      you are so very ignorant. Let us stick to facts. What do you wish to
      know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who killed Sidney Bolton: who has the emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you. Listen! With my past life you have nothing to do. I
      will commence from the time I came down here. I had just lost my husband,
      and I managed to scrape together a few hundred pounds&mdash;oh, quite in a
      respectable way, I assure you," she added scoffingly, on seeing her
      listener wince. "I came here to try and live quietly, and, if possible, to
      secure a rich husband. I knew that the Fort was here and thought that I
      might marry an officer. However, the Professor's position attracted me,
      and I decided to marry him. I am engaged, and but for your cleverness in
      tracing that letter I should be Mrs. Braddock within a very short time. I
      have exhausted all my money. I am deeply, in debt. I cannot hold out
      longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the money you inherited&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all bluff also. I never had a brother. I inherit no money. I know
      nothing of Pekin, save that a friend of mine sends that scent to me as a
      yearly Christmas present. I am an adventuress, but perhaps not so bad as
      you think me. Lucy and Donna Inez have heard no wickedness from my lips. I
      have always been a good woman in one sense&mdash;a moral woman, that is&mdash;and
      I did wish to marry the Professor and live a happy life. Seeing that I was
      at the end of my resources, and that Professor Braddock expected a legacy
      with me before marriage, I looked round to, see how I could get the money.
      I heard that you were accused by Captain Hervey, and so last night I wrote
      that letter and posted it in London, thinking that you would yield to save
      yourself from arrest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random laughed cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have thought me weak," he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did," said Mrs. Jasher frankly. "To tell you the truth, I thought that
      you were a fool. But by tracing that letter and withstanding my demand,
      you have proved yourself to be more clever than I took you to be. Well,
      that is all. I know nothing of the murder. My letter is sheer bluff to
      extort from you five thousand pounds. Had you paid I should have passed it
      off to the Professor as the money left to me by my brother. But now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said Random, rising to go, "I shall tell what you have told me to
      the Professor, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And hand me over to the police," said Mrs. Jasher, shrugging her plump
      shoulders, "Well, I expected that. Yet I fancied for old times' sake that
      you might have been more lenient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were never anything but acquaintances, Mrs. Jasher," said Random
      coldly, "so I fail to see why you should expect mercy after the way in
      which you have behaved. You expect to blackmail me, and yet go free. I
      must punish you somehow, so I shall tell Professor Braddock, as you
      certainly cannot marry him. But I shall not hand you over to the police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't?" Mrs. Jasher stared, scarcely able to believe her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Give me a day to think over matters, and I shall arrange what to do
      with you. I think there is some good in you, Mrs. Jasher, and so I shall
      see if I can't assist you. In the meantime I shall have your cottage
      watched, so that you may not run away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, you may as well hand me over to the police," she said
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," rejoined Random coolly. "I can trust my servant, who is
      stupid but honest and is devoted to me. I'll see that everything is kept
      quiet. But if you attempt to run away I shall have you arrested for
      blackmail. You understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You are treating me very well," she gasped. "When shall I see you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow evening. I must talk the matter over with Braddock. To-morrow I
      shall arrange what to do, and probably I shall give you a chance of
      leading a new life in some other part of the world. What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept. Indeed, there is nothing else left for me to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is an ungrateful speech," said Random severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay. However, we can talk of gratitude to-morrow. Meanwhile, please
      leave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Frank went to the door and there paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember," he said distinctly, "that your cottage is being watched. Try
      to escape and I shall have you arrested."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher groaned and buried her face in the sofa cushion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. A WEDDING PRESENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher had thought Random exceedingly clever in acting as he had done
      to trap her. She would have thought him still more clever had she known
      that he trusted to the power of suggestion to prevent her from trying to
      escape. Sir Frank had not the slightest intention of setting his
      soldier-servant to watch, as such was not the duty for which such servants
      are hired. But having impressed firmly on the adventuress's mind that he
      would act in this way, he departed, quite certain that the woman would not
      attempt to run away. Although no one was watching the cottage, Mrs.
      Jasher, believing what had been told her, would think that sharp eyes were
      on her doors and windows day and night, and would firmly believe that if
      she tried to get away she would be captured forthwith by the Pierside
      police, or perhaps by the village constable. Like an Eastern enchanter,
      the baronet had placed a spell on the cottage, and it acted admirably.
      Mrs. Jasher, although longing to escape and hide herself, remained where
      she was, cowed by a spy who did not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Random went to the Pyramids as soon as his duties permitted
      and saw the Professor. To the prospective bridegroom he explained all that
      had happened, and displayed the anonymous letter, with an account of how
      he had proved Mrs. Jasher to be the writer. Braddock's hair could not
      stand on end, as he had none, but he lost his temper completely, and raged
      up and down the museum in a way which frightened Cockatoo out of his
      barbaric wits. When more quiet he sat down to discuss the matter, and
      promptly demanded that Mrs. Jasher should be handed over to the police.
      But he might have guessed that Sir Frank would refuse to follow this
      extreme advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has acted badly, I admit," said the young man. "All the same, I think
      she is a better woman than you may think, Professor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think! think! think!" shouted the fiery little man, getting up once more
      to trot up and down like an infuriated poodle. "I think she is a bad
      woman, a wicked woman. To deceive me into thinking her rich and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely, Professor, you wished to marry her also for love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the sort, sir: nothing of the sort. I leave love and such-like
      trash to those like yourself and Hope, who have nothing else to think
      about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a marriage without love&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! pooh! pooh! Don't argue with me, Random. Love is all moonshine. I
      did not love my first wife&mdash;Lucy's mother&mdash;and yet we were very
      happy. Had I made Mrs. Jasher my second, we should have got on
      excellently, provided the money was forthcoming for my Egyptian
      expedition. What am I to do now, I ask you, Random? Even the thousand
      pounds you pay for the mummy goes back to that infernal Hope because of
      Lucy's silly ideas. I have nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing, and that tomb
      is amongst those Ethiopian hills, I swear, waiting to be opened. Oh, what
      a chance I have missed!&mdash;what a chance! But I shall see Mrs. Jasher
      myself. She knows about this murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She declares that she does not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tell me! don't tell me!" vociferated the Professor. "She would not
      have written that letter had she known nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was bluff. I explained all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bluff be hanged!" cried Braddock, only he used a more vigorous word. "I
      do not believe that she would have dared to act on such a slight
      foundation. I shall see her myself this very afternoon and force her to
      confess. In one way or another I shall find the assassin and make him
      disgorge those emeralds under the penalty of being hanged. Then I can sell
      them and finance my Egyptian expedition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you forget, Professor, that the emeralds, when found, belong to Don
      Pedro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't," rasped the little man, turning purple with rage. "I refuse
      to let him have them. I bought the mummy, and the contents of the mummy,
      including those emeralds. They are mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Random sharply. "I buy the mummy, from you, so they pass into
      my possession and belong to De Gayangos. I shall give them to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to find them first," said Braddock savagely; "and as to the
      mummy, you shan't have it. I decline to sell it. So there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't," said Random very distinctly, "Don Pedro will bring an
      action against you, and Captain Hervey will be called as a witness to
      prove that the mummy was stolen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro hasn't the money," said Braddock triumphantly; "he can't pay
      lawyer's fees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can," rejoined the young man very dryly. "As I am going to marry
      Donna Inez, it is only just that I should help my future father-in-law in
      every way. He has a romantic feeling about this relic of poor humanity and
      wishes to take it back to Peru. He shall do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about me?&mdash;what about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Random, speaking slowly with the intention of still further
      irritating the little man, whose selfishness annoyed him, "if I were you I
      should marry Mrs. Jasher and settle down quietly in this house to live on
      what income you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock turned purple again and spluttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you make a proposition like that to me, sir?" he bellowed. "You
      ask me to marry this low woman, this adventuress, this&mdash;this&mdash;this&mdash;"
      Words failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Random had no intention of advising such a marriage, although he
      did not think so badly of Mrs. Jasher as did the Professor. But the little
      man was so venomous that the young man took a delight in stirring him up,
      using the widow's name as a red rag to this particular bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think Mrs. Jasher is a bad woman," he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! what! what! After what she has done? Blackmail! blackmail!
      blackmail!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is bad, I admit, but she has failed to get what she wanted, and,
      after all, you indirectly are the cause of her writing that blackmailing
      letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am?&mdash;I am? How dare you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, she wanted to get five thousand out of me as her dowry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and told me lies about her damned brother who was a Pekin merchant,
      when after all he never existed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't defend that," said Random coolly. "Mrs. Jasher has behaved
      badly on the whole. Still, Professor, I think there is good in her, as I
      said before. She evidently had bad parents and a bad husband; but, so far
      as I can gather, she is not an immoral woman. The poor wretch only came
      here to try and drag herself out of the mire. If she had married you I
      feel sure that she would have made you a most excellent wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor was in such a rage that he suddenly became calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you talk absolute rubbish," he said caustically. "Had I my way
      this woman would be whipped at a cart's tail for the shameful way in which
      she has deceived us all. However, I shall see her to-day and make her
      confess who murdered Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Pedro will be greatly obliged if you do. He wants those emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I, and if I get them I shall keep them," snapped Braddock; "and if
      you haven't anything more to say you can leave me. I'm busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing more to be done with the choleric little man, Sir
      Frank took the hint and departed. He went forthwith to the Warrior Inn to
      see Don Pedro and also Donna Inez. But it so happened that the girl had
      gone to the Pyramids on a visit to Miss Kendal, and Random was sorry that
      he had missed her. However, it was just as well, as he could now talk
      freely to De Gayangos. To him he related the whole story of Mrs. Jasher,
      and discovered that the Peruvian also, as Braddock had done, insisted that
      Mrs. Jasher knew the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She would not have written that letter if she did not know it," said Don
      Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you think that she should be arrested?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. We can deal with this matter ourselves. At present she is quite safe,
      as she certainly will not leave her cottage, seeing that she thinks it is
      being watched. Let us permit Braddock to interview her, and see what he
      can learn. Then we can discuss the matter and come to a decision."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random nodded absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if Mrs. Jasher was the woman who talked to Bolton through the
      window?" he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not impossible. Although that does not explain why Bolton borrowed
      a female disguise from this mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jasher might have worn it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would argue some understanding between Bolton and Mrs. Jasher, and a
      knowledge of the manuscript before Bolton left for Malta. We know that he
      could only have seen the manuscript for the first time at Malta. It was
      evidently stowed away in the swathings of the mummy by my father, who
      forgot all about it when he gave me the original."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hervey forgot also. I wonder if that is true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am certain it is," said Don Pedro emphatically, "for, if Hervey, or
      Vasa, or whatever you like to call him, had found that manuscript and had
      got it translated, he certainly would have opened the mummy and have
      secured the emeralds. No, Sir Frank, I believe that his theory is partly
      true. Bolton intended to run away with the emeralds, and send the empty
      mummy to Professor Braddock; for, if you remember, he arranged that the
      landlord of the Sailor's Rest should forward the case next morning, even
      if he happened to be away. Bolton intended to be away&mdash;with the
      emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you do not believe that Hervey placed the manuscript in my room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He declared most emphatically that he did not," said Don Pedro, "when at
      Pierside yesterday I went to the Sailor's Rest and saw him. He told
      Braddock only the other day that he had lost his chance of a sailing
      vessel, and, as yet, had not got another one. But when he returned to
      Pierside he found a letter waiting him&mdash;so he told me&mdash;giving
      him command of a four thousand ton tramp steamer called The Firefly. He is
      to sail at once&mdash;to-morrow, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what is he going to do about this murder business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can do nothing at present, as, if he remains in Pierside, he will lose
      his new command. To-morrow he drops down stream, but meantime he intends
      to write out the whole story of the theft of the mummy. I have promised to
      give him fifty pounds for doing so, as I want to get back the mummy, free
      of charge, from Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Braddock will stick to the mummy in any event," said Random
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not when Hervey writes out his evidence. He will not have it completed by
      the time he sails, as he is very busy. But he has promised to send off a
      boat to the jetty near the Fort to-morrow evening, when he is dropping
      down stream. I shall be there with fifty pounds in gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing he fails to stop or send the boat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he will not get his fifty pounds," retorted Don Pedro. "The man is a
      rascal, and deserves prison rather than reward, but since the mummy was
      stolen by him thirty years back, he alone can prove my ownership."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why take all this trouble?" argued the baronet. "I can buy the mummy
      from Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Don Pedro. "I have a right to my own property."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random lingered until late in the afternoon and until darkness fell, as he
      was anxious to see Donna Inez. But she did not appear until late.
      Meanwhile Archie Hope put in an appearance, having come to see Don Pedro
      with an account of his interview with Widow Anne. Before coming to the inn
      he had called on Professor Braddock, and from him had heard all about the
      wickedness of Mrs. Jasher. His surprise was very great.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not have believed it," he declared. "Poor woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Random, rather pleased, "you are more merciful than the
      Professor, Hope. He calls her a bad woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! I don't think that Braddock is so good that he can afford to throw
      a stone," said Archie rather sourly. "Mrs. Jasher has not behaved well,
      but I should like to hear her complete story before judging. There must be
      a lot of good in her, or Lucy, who has been with her a great deal, would
      have found her out long ago. I go by a woman's judgment of a woman. But
      Mrs. Jasher must have been anxious to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was; as Professor Braddock knows," said Random quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not thinking of that so much as of what Widow Anne told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Don Pedro, looking up from where he was seated, "so you have
      seen that old woman? What does she say about the clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sticks to her story. Sidney, she declares, borrowed the clothes to
      give to me for a model. Now, I never asked Bolton to do this, so I fancy
      the disguise must have been intended for himself, or for Mrs. Jasher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what had Mrs. Jasher to do with him?" demanded Random sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's odd," replied Hope slowly, "but Mrs. Bolton declares that her
      son was in love with Mrs. Jasher, and when he returned from Malta intended
      to marry her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" cried Sir Frank. "She engaged herself to Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But only after Bolton's death, remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true. But what you say, Mr. Hope, proves the truth of Hervey's
      theory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jasher, as we know from what Random told us, wanted money. She would
      not marry a man who was poor. Bolton was poor, but of course the emeralds
      would make him wealthy, as they are of immense value. Probably he intended
      to steal them in order to marry this woman. This implicates Mrs. Jasher in
      the crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," assented Sir Frank, nodding. "But as Bolton did not know that the
      emeralds existed before he bought the mummy in Malta, I do not see why he
      should borrow a disguise beforehand for Mrs. Jasher to meet him at the
      Sailor's Rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing is easily settled," said Hope impatiently. "Let us both go to
      Mrs. Jasher's this evening, and insist upon the truth being told. If she
      confesses about her secret engagement to Sidney Bolton, she may admit that
      the clothes were borrowed for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she may admit also that she placed the manuscript in my room," said
      Sir Frank after a pause. "Hervey did not place it there, but it is just
      possible that Mrs. Jasher, having got it from Bolton when she talked to
      him through the window, may have done so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" said Hope with vigorous commonsense. "Mrs. Jasher would be
      spotted in a moment if she had gone to your quarters. She had to pass the
      sentry, remember. Then, again, we have not yet proved that she was the
      woman in Mrs. Bolton's clothes who spoke through the window. That can all
      be settled if we speak to her this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good." Random glanced at his watch. "I must get back. Don Pedro,
      will you tell Inez that I shall come in this evening? We can then talk
      further about these matters. Hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall stop here, as I wish to consult Don Pedro."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random nodded and took a reluctant departure. He dearly wished, as an
      engaged lover should, to remain on the chance that Donna Inez might
      return, but duty called him and he was forced to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was very dark, although it was not particularly late. But there
      was no rain, and Random walked rapidly through the village and down the
      road to the Fort. He caught a glimpse of the lights of Mrs. Jasher's
      cottage twinkling in the distance, and smiled grimly as he thought of the
      invisible spell he had placed thereon. No doubt Mrs. Jasher was shivering
      in her Louis Quinze shoes at the idea of being watched. But then, she
      deserved that much punishment at least, as Random truly thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      When entering the Fort, the sentry saluted as usual, and Random was about
      to pass, when the man stepped forward, holding out a brown paper package.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir, I found this in my sentry box," he said, saluting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Frank took the packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who placed it there? and why do you give it to me?" he demanded in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir, it's directed to you, sir, and I don't know who put it in my
      box, sir. I was on duty, sir, and I 'spose someone must have dropped it on
      the floor of the box, sir, when I was at the other end of my beat, sir. It
      was as dark as this, sir, and I saw nothing and heard nothing. When I come
      back, sir, I stepped into the box out of the rain and felt it with my
      feet. I struck a light, sir, and found it was for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Frank slipped the package into his pocket and went away after a grim
      word or so to the sentry, advising him to be more on the alert. He was
      puzzled to think who had left the packet in the sentry box, and curious to
      know what it contained. As soon as he got to his own room, he cut the
      string which bound loosely the brown paper. Then, in the lamplight, there
      rolled out from the carelessly-tied parcel a glorious sea-green emerald of
      great size, radiating light like a sun. A scrap of white paper lay in the
      brown wrapping. On it was written, "A wedding gift for Sir Frank Random."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. JUST IN TIME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all the surprises in connection with the tragedy of the green mummy,
      this was surely the greatest. Sidney Bolton had undoubtedly been murdered
      for the sake of the emeralds, and the assassin had escaped with the spoil,
      for which he had sold his soul. Yet here was one of the jewels returned
      anonymously to Random, who could pass on the same to its rightful owner.
      In the midst of his amazement Sir Frank could not help chuckling when he
      thought how enraged Professor Braddock would be at Don Pedro's good
      fortune. At the eleventh hour, as it were, the Peruvian had got back his
      own, or at least a portion of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the emerald in his drawer, Random gave orders to his servant that
      the sentry, when off duty, should be brought before him. Just as Random
      finished dressing for mess&mdash;and he dressed very early, so as to
      devote his entire attention to solving this new problem&mdash;the soldier
      who had been on guard appeared. But he could tell nothing more than he had
      already related. When doing sentry-go immediately outside the gate of the
      Fort, the packet had been slipped into the box, while the man was at the
      far end of his beat. It was quite dark when this was done, and the soldier
      confessed that he had not heard a sound, much less had he seen anyone. The
      person who had brought the glorious gem had watched his opportunity, and,
      soft-footed as a cat, had stolen forward in the darkness to drop the
      precious parcel on the floor of the sentry box. There the man had found it
      by the feel of his feet, when he stepped in some time later to escape a
      shower. But what time had elapsed from the placing of the parcel to its
      discovery by the sentry it was impossible to say. It must, however, as
      Random calculated, have been within the hour, since, before then, it would
      not have been dark enough to hide the approach of the person, whether male
      or female, who carried a king's ransom in the brown paper parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Random was inclined to place the sentry under arrest for having
      failed so much in his duty as to allow anyone to approach so near the
      Fort; but, as he had already reprimanded the man, and, moreover, wished to
      keep the fact of the recovered jewel quiet, he simply dismissed him. When
      alone, he sat down before the fire, wondering who could have dared so very
      greatly, and for what reason the emerald had been handed to him. If it had
      been sent to Don Pedro, or even to Professor Braddock, it would have been
      much more reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It first occurred to him that Mrs. Jasher, out of gratitude for the way in
      which he had treated her, had sent him the jewel. Remembering his former
      experience, he smelt the parcel, but could detect no sign of the famous
      Chinese scent which had proved a clue to the letter. Of course the
      direction on the packet and the inscribed slip of paper were in feigned
      handwriting, so he could gather nothing from that. Still, he did not think
      that Mrs. Jasher had sent the emerald. She was desperately hard up, and if
      she had become possessed of the gem by murder&mdash;presuming her to have
      been the woman who talked to Bolton through the window&mdash;she assuredly
      would have sold it to supply her own needs. Certainly, if guilty, she
      would still possess the other emerald, of equal value; but undoubtedly,
      had she risked her neck to gain a fortune, she would have kept the entire
      plunder which was likely to cost her so dear. No; whomsoever it was who
      had repented at the eleventh hour, Mrs. Jasher was not the person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Widow Anne was the woman who had talked through the window, and
      who had restored the emerald. But that was impossible, since Mrs. Bolton
      habitually took more liquor than was good for her, and would not have the
      nerve to deliver the jewel, much less commit the crime, the more
      especially as the victim was her own son. Of course she might have found
      out Sidney's scheme to run away with the jewels, and so would have claimed
      her share. But if she had been in Pierside on that evening&mdash;and her
      presence in Gartley had been sworn to by three or four cronies&mdash;she
      would have guessed who had strangled her boy. If so, not all the jewels in
      the world would have prevented her denouncing the criminal. With all her
      faults&mdash;and they were many&mdash;Mrs. Bolton was a good mother, and
      looked upon Sidney as the pride and joy of her somewhat dissipated life.
      Mrs. Bolton was certainly as innocent as Mrs. Jasher.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained Hervey. Random laughed aloud when the name came into his
      puzzled head. That buccaneer was the last person to surrender his plunder
      or to feel compunction in committing a crime. Once the skipper got his
      grip on two jewels, worth endless money, he would never let them go&mdash;not
      even one of them. Arguing thus, it seemed that Hervey was out of the
      running, and Random could think of no one else. In this dilemma he
      remembered that two heads were better than one, and, before going into
      dinner, he sent a note to Archie Hope, asking him to come to the Fort as
      speedily as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Frank was somewhat dull at dinner on that evening, and scarcely
      responded to the joking remarks of his brother officers. These jocularly
      put his preoccupation down to love, for it was an open secret that the
      baronet admired the fair Peruvian, although no one as yet knew that Random
      was legally engaged with Don Pedro's consent. The young man good-humoredly
      stood all the chaff hurled at him, but seized the opportunity to slip away
      to his quarters as soon as coffee came on the table and the smoking began.
      It was nine o'clock before he returned to his room, and here he found Hope
      waiting for him impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you have been dining at the Pyramids," said Random, seeing that
      Hope was in evening dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I don't put on this kit to have my humble chop at my lodgings. But
      the Professor asked me to dinner to talk over matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he say?" asked Random, looking for the cigarette box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he is very angry with Mrs. Jasher, and considers that she has
      swindled him. He called to see her this afternoon, and&mdash;so he says&mdash;had
      a stormy interview with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wonder at that, if he speaks as he generally does," said the
      other grimly, and pushing along the cigarettes, "There you are! The whisky
      and soda are on yonder table. Make yourself comfortable, and tell me what
      the Professor intends to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Archie, turning half round from the side table where he was
      pouring out the whisky, "he had already started action, by sending
      Cockatoo to live at the Sailor's Rest and spy on Hervey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What rubbish! Hervey is, going away to-morrow in The Firefly, bound for
      Algiers. Nothing is to be learned from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I told the Professor," said Hope, returning to the armchair near the
      fire, "and I mentioned that Don Pedro had induced the skipper to write out
      a full account of the theft of the mummy from Lima thirty years ago. I
      also said that the signed paper would be handed in at the Gartley jetty
      when The Firefly came down stream to-morrow night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! And what did Braddock say to that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing much. He merely stated that whatever Hervey said toward proving
      the ownership of your future father-in-law, that he intended to stick to
      the embalmed corpse of Inca Caxas, and also that he intended to claim the
      emeralds when they turned up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random rose and went to the drawer of his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid he has lost one emerald, at all events," he said, unlocking
      the drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" said Hope sharply. "Why did you&mdash;oh, gosh!" He jumped
      up with an amazed look as Random held up the magnificent gem, from which
      streamed vividly green flames in the mellow lamplight. "Oh, gosh!" gasped
      the artist again. "Where the devil did you get that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sent for you to tell you," said Sir Frank, giving the jewel into his
      friend's hand and coming back to his seat. "It was found in the sentry
      box."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope stared at the great jewel and then at the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?" he demanded. "How the dickens could it be
      found in a sentry box? You must be making a mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it. It was found on the floor of the box by the sentry, as I
      tell you, and I have sent to consult with you as to how the deuce it got
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hervey," muttered Archie, fascinated by the gem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random shrugged his square shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catch that Yankee Shylock returning anything he got his grip on, even as
      a wedding present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wedding present," said Hope, more at sea than ever. "If you don't mind
      giving me details, old chap, my head would buzz less."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather think that it will buzz more," said Random dryly, and, producing
      the brown paper in which the gem had been wrapped, and the inscribed paper
      found within, he related all that had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie listened quietly and did not interrupt, but the puzzled look on his
      face grew more pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," ended Random, seeing that no remark was made when he had finished,
      "what do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord knows! I'll go out of my mind if these sort of things come along. I
      am a simple sort of chap, and have no use for mysteries which beat all the
      detective stories I have ever read. That sort of thing is all very well in
      fiction, but in real life&mdash;humph! What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give back the emerald to Don Pedro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, though, it is given to you for a wedding present. And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then"&mdash;Random stared into the fire&mdash;"I don't know. I asked you
      in to assist me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly; but how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Random pondered for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who sent that emerald to me, do you think?" he asked, looking squarely at
      the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope meditatively turned the jewel in his long fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not ask Mrs. Jasher?" he suggested suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" Sir Frank shook his head. "I fancied it might be her, but it cannot
      be. If she is guilty&mdash;as she must be, should she have sent the
      emerald&mdash;she would not part with her plunder when she is so hard up.
      I am beginning to believe, Hope, that what she said was true about the
      letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean exactly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the letter was mere bluff and that she really knows nothing about
      the crime. By the way, did Braddock learn anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a thing. He merely said that the two of them fought. I expect
      Braddock stormed and Mrs. Jasher retorted. Both of them have too much
      tongue-music to come to any understanding. By the way&mdash;to echo, your
      own phrase&mdash;you had better put away this gem or I shall be strangling
      you myself in order to gain possession of it. The mere sight of that
      gorgeous color tempts me beyond my strength."
    </p>
    <p>
      Random laughed and locked the jewel in his drawer. Hope suggested that
      with such a flimsy lock it was unsafe, but the baronet shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is safer here than in a woman's jewel case," he asserted. "No one
      looks to my drawer, and certainly no one would expect to find a crown
      jewel of this description in my quarters. Well," he came back to his seat,
      slipping his keys into his trouser pocket, "the whole thing puzzles me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not do as I suggest and go to Mrs. Jasher? In any case you are going
      there to-night, are you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I want to decide what to do about the woman. I had intended to go
      alone, but as you are here you may as well come also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be delighted. What do you intend to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help her," said Random briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She doesn't deserve it," replied Hope, lighting a fresh cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does anyone ever deserve anything?" asked Sir Frank cynically. "What does
      Miss Kendal think of the business? I suppose Braddock told her. He has too
      long a tongue to keep anything to himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told her at dinner, when I was present. Lucy is quite on your side.
      She says that she had known Mrs. Jasher for months and that there is good
      in her, although I am bound to say that Lucy was a trifle shocked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she want Mrs. Jasher to marry her father now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her step-father," corrected Archie immediately. "No, that is out of the
      question. But she would like Mrs. Jasher to be helped out of her
      difficulties and have a fair start. It was only by the greatest diplomacy
      that I prevented Lucy going to see the wretched woman this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you prevent her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay I am a trifle prudish," he replied, "but after what has
      happened I do not wish Lucy to associate with Mrs. Jasher. Do you blame
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't. All the same, I don't think that Mrs. Jasher is an immoral
      woman by any means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not; but we needn't discuss her character, as we know precious
      little of her past, and she no doubt told you the story that best suited
      herself. I think it will be best to make her tell all she knows this
      evening, and then send her away with a sum of money in her pocket to begin
      a new life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall help her certainly," said Random, with his eyes on the fire, "but
      can't say exactly how. It is my opinion that the poor wretch is more
      sinned against than sinning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a soldier with a conscience, Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't a soldier have a conscience? Do you take your idea of
      officers from the lady novelist, who makes us out to be all idle idiots?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly. All the same, many a man would not take the trouble to
      behave as you are doing to this unlucky woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any man, who was a man, whether soldier or civilian, would help such a
      poor creature. And I believe, Hope, that you will help her also."
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist leaped to his feet impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I'm with you right along, as Hervey would say. But first,
      before deciding what we shall do to set Mrs. Jasher on her legs again, let
      us hear what she has to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can say nothing more than she has said," remonstrated Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe that," replied Hope, reaching for his overcoat. "You may
      choose to believe that the letter was the outcome of bluff. But I really
      and truly think that Mrs. Jasher is in the know. What is more, I believe
      that Bolton got her those clothes, and that she was the woman who talked
      to him&mdash;went there to see how the little scheme was progressing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I thought that," said Random coldly, "I would not help Mrs. Jasher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, you would. The greater the sinner the more need she or he has of
      help, you know, my dear fellow. But get your coat on, and let us toddle. I
      don't suppose we need pistols."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Frank laughed, as, aided by the artist, he struggled into his military
      greatcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose that Mrs. Jasher will be dangerous," he remarked. "We'll
      get what we can out of her, and then arrange what is best to be done to
      recoup her fallen fortunes. Then she can go where she chooses, and we can,&mdash;as
      the French say&mdash;return to our muttons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Donna Inez and Lucy would be annoyed to hear themselves called
      muttons," laughed Archie, and the two men left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was darker than ever, and a fine rain was falling incessantly.
      When they left the dimly lighted archway of the fort through the smaller,
      gate set in the larger one they stepped into midnight blackness such as
      must have been spread over the land of Egypt. In accordance with the
      primitive customs of Gartley inhabitants, one of them at least should have
      been furnished with a lantern, as it was no easy task to pick a clean way
      through the mud.&mdash;-However, Archie, knowing the surroundings better
      even than Random, led the way, and they walked slowly through the iron
      gate on the hard high road which led to the Fort. Immediately beyond this
      they turned towards the narrow cinder path which led through the marshes
      to Mrs. Jasher's cottage, and toiled on cautiously through the misty rain,
      which fell continuously. The fog was drifting up from the mouth of the
      river and was growing so thick that they could not see the somewhat feeble
      lights of the cottage. However, Archie's instincts led him aright, and
      they blundered finally upon the wooden gate. Here they paused in shocked
      surprise, for a woman's scream rang out wildly and suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, in heaven's name, is that?" asked Hope, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must find out," breathed Random, and raced through the white
      cotton-wool of the fog up the path. As he reached the veranda the door
      opened and a woman came running out screaming. But other screams inside
      the cottage still continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" cried Random, seizing the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She proved to be Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, my mistress is being murdered&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope plunged past her into the corridor, not waiting to hear more. The
      cries had died down to a low moaning, and he dashed into the pink parlor
      to find it in smoky darkness. Striking a match, he held it above his head.
      It showed Mrs. Jasher prone on the floor, and a dark figure smashing its
      way through the flimsy window. There was a snarl and the figure vanished
      as the match went out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. A CONFESSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jane was still being held by Sir Frank at the floor, and was still
      screaming, fully convinced that her captor was a burglar, in spite of
      having recognized him by his voice. Random was so exasperated by her
      stupidity that he shook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, you fool?" he demanded. "Don't you know that I am a
      friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Y-e-s, s-i-r," gasped Jane, fetching her breath again after the shaking;
      "but go for the police. My mistress is being murdered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hope is looking after that, and the screams have ceased. Who was with
      your mistress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, sir," sobbed the servant. "I didn't know anyone had called,
      and then I heard the screaming. I looked into the parlor to see what was
      the matter, but the lamp had been thrown over and had gone out, and there
      was a dreadful struggle going on in the darkness, so I screamed and ran
      out and then I&mdash;oh&mdash;oh" Jane showed symptoms of renewed
      hysteria, and clutched Random tightly, as a man came cautiously round the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you there, Random?" asked Hope's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so infernally dark and foggy that I have missed him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Missed who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who was trying to murder Mrs. Jasher, He got her down when I
      entered and struck a match. Then he dashed through the window before I
      could catch him or even recognize him. He's vanished in the mist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no use looking for him anyhow," said Random, peering into the dense
      blackness, which was thick with damp. "We had better see after Mrs.
      Jasher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom have you got there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane&mdash;who seems to have lost her head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a mercy I haven't lost my life, sir, with burglars and murderers all
      about the place," sobbed the girl, dropping on to the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random promptly hauled her to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and get a candle, and keep calm if you can," he said in an abrupt
      military voice. "This is no time to play the fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      His sharpness had great effect on the girl, and she became much more her
      usual self. Hope lighted another match, and the trio proceeded through the
      passage towards the kitchen, where Jane had left a lamp burning. Seizing
      this from its bracket, Sir Frank retraced his way along the passage to the
      pink parlor, followed closely by Hope and timorously by Jane. A dreadful
      scene presented itself. The dainty little room was literally smashed to
      pieces, as though a gigantic bull had been wallowing therein. The lamp lay
      on the floor, surrounded by several extinguished candles. It was a mercy
      that all the lights had been put out when overturned, else the gim-crack
      cottage would have been long since in a blaze. Chairs and tables and
      screens were also overturned, and the one window had its rose-hued
      curtains torn down and its glass broken, showing only too clearly the way
      in which the murderer had escaped. And that the man who had attacked Mrs.
      Jasher was a murderer could be seen from the stream of blood that ran
      slowly from Mrs. Jasher's breast. Apparently she had been stabbed in the
      lungs, for the wound was on the right side. There she lay, poor woman, in
      her tawdry finery, crumpled up, battered and bruised, dead amongst the
      ruins of her home. Jane immediately began to scream again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop her, Hope," cried Random, who was kneeling by the body and feeling
      the heart. "Mrs. Jasher is not dead. Hold your noise, woman, and go for a
      doctor." This was to Jane, who, prevented from screaming, took to
      whimpering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had better go," said Hope quickly; "and I'll go to the Fort and alarm
      the men. Perhaps they may catch the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you describe him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," said Archie indignantly. "I only caught a glimpse of him
      by the feeble light of a lucifer match. Then he leaped through the window
      and I after him. I made a grab at him, but lost him in the mist. I don't
      know in the least what he is like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how can anyone arrest him?" snapped Random, raising Mrs. Jasher's
      head. "Give what alarm you like, but race for Robinson up the village. We
      must save this poor woman's life, if only to learn who killed her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she isn't dead yet&mdash;she isn't dead yet," wailed Jane, clapping
      her hands, while Hope, knowing the value of time, promptly ran out of the
      house to get further assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She soon will be," said Sir Frank, whose temper was not of the best at so
      critical a moment in dealing with a fool. "Go and bring me brandy at once,
      and afterwards linen and hot water. We must do our best to staunch this
      wound and revive her."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next quarter of an hour the man and the woman labored hard to save
      Mrs. Jasher's life. Random bound up the wound in a rough and ready
      fashion, and Jane fed the pale lips of her mistress with sips of brandy.
      Mrs. Jasher gradually became more alive, and a faint sigh escaped from her
      lips, as her wounded bosom rose and fell with recovered breath. When Sir
      Frank was in hopes that she would speak, she suddenly relapsed again into
      a comatose state. Luckily at that moment Archie returned with young Dr.
      Robinson at his heels, and also was followed by Painter, the village
      constable, who had luckily been picked up in the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robinson whistled as he looked at the insensible woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's had a narrow squeak," he muttered, lifting the body with the
      assistance of Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will she recover?" questioned Hope anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you yet," answered the doctor; and with Sir Frank he carried
      the heavy body of the widow into her bedroom. "How did it happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my business," said Painter, who had followed, and who was now
      filled with importance. "You look after the body, sir, and I'll question
      these gentlemen and the servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Servant yourself! Such sauce!" muttered Jane, with an angry toss of her
      cap at the daring young policeman. "I know nothing. I left my mistress in
      the parlor writing letters, and never heard anyone come in. The bell
      didn't sound anyhow. The first thing I knew that anything was wrong was on
      hearing the screams. When I looked into the parlor the candles and the
      lamp were out, and there was a struggle going on in the dark. Then I cried
      out, very naturally, I'm sure, and ran straight into the arms of these
      gentlemen, as soon as I could get the front door open."
    </p>
    <p>
      After delivering this address, Jane was called away to assist the doctor
      in the bedroom, and along with Archie and Random the constable repaired to
      the pink parlor to hear what they had to say. Of course they could tell
      him even less than Jane had told, and Archie protested that he was quite
      unable to describe the man who had dashed out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Painter sapiently, "he got out there; but how did he enter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt by the door," said Random sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't know that, sir. Jane says she did not hear the bell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jasher might have let the man in, whomsoever he was, secretly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should she, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! now you are asking more than I can tell you. Only Mrs. Jasher can
      explain, and it seems to me that she will die."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in some mysterious way the news of the crime had spread through
      the village, and although it was growing late&mdash;for it was past ten
      o'clock&mdash;a dozen or so of villagers came along. Also there arrived a
      number of soldiers under a smart sergeant, and to him Sir Frank explained
      what had happened. In the fainthearted way&mdash;for the mist was now like
      cotton-wool&mdash;the military and the civilians hunted through the
      marshes round the cottage, hoping to come across the assassin hiding in a
      ditch. Needless to say, they found no one and nothing, for it was worse
      than looking for a needle in a bundle of hay. The man had come out of the
      mist, and, after executing the deed, had vanished into the mist, and there
      was not the very slightest chance of finding him. Gradually, as it drew
      towards midnight, the soldiers went back to the Fort, and the villagers to
      their homes. But, along with the doctor and the constable, Hope and his
      military friend stopped on. They were determined to get at the root of the
      mystery, and when Mrs. Jasher became sensible she would be able to reveal
      the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all of a piece with the sending of the emerald," said Random to the
      artist, "and that is connected, as we know, with the death of Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think that this man who has struck down Mrs. Jasher is the same
      one who strangled Sidney Bolton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so. Perhaps Mrs. Jasher sent the emerald after all, and
      this man killed her out of revenge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how would he know that she had the emerald?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows! She may have been his accomplice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie knit his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who the devil can this mysterious person be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only reply as you have done, my friend. God knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am certain that God will not let him escape this time. This will
      bring Gartley once more into notoriety," went on Hope. "By the way, I saw
      one of the servants from the Pyramids here. I hope the fool won't go home
      and frighten Lucy's life out of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to the Pyramids and see her," suggested Sir Frank. "Mrs. Jasher is
      still unconscious, and will be for hours, the doctor tells me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too late to go to the Pyramids, Random."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they know of this new tragedy there, I'll bet they are not in bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same, I'll remain here until Mrs. Jasher can speak," he said, and
      sat smoking with Random in the dining-room, as the most comfortable room
      in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constable Painter camped, so to speak, in the drawing-room, keeping guard
      over the scene of the crime, and had placed the Chinese screen against the
      broken window to keep out the cold. In the bedroom Jane and Dr. Robinson
      looked after the dying woman. And dying she was, according to the young
      physician, for he did not think she would live much longer. Round the
      lonely cottage the sea-mist drifted white and thick, and the darkness
      deepened, until&mdash;as the saying goes&mdash;it could have been cut with
      a knife. Never was there so eerie and weary and sinister a vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards four o'clock Hope fell into a doze, while resting in an arm-chair;
      but he was suddenly aroused from this by an exclamation from Sir Frank,
      who had remained wide awake, smoking cigar after cigar. In a moment the
      artist was on his feet, alert and quick-brained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Random made for the dining-room door rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I heard Painter call out," he declared, and hastily sought the
      parlor, followed by Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was empty, but the screen before the broken window had been
      thrown down, and they could see Painter's bulky form immediately outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce is the matter?" demanded Random, entering. "Did you call
      out, Painter. I fancied I heard something."
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable came in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did call out, sir," he confessed. "I was half asleep in that chair,
      when I suddenly became wide awake, and believed I saw a face looking at me
      round the corner of the screen. I jumped up, calling for you, sir, and
      upset the screen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well? well?" demanded Sir Frank impatiently, and seeing that the man
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw no one, sir. All the same, I had an idea, and I have still, that a
      man came through the window and peered at me from behind the screen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who attacked Mrs. Jasher?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say, sir. But there was someone. At any rate he's gone again, if
      he really did come, and there is no chance of finding him. It's like
      pea-soup outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope and Random simultaneously stepped through the window, but could not
      see an inch before them, so thick was the sea-fog and so dense was the
      darkness. Returning, they replaced the screen, and, telling Painter to be
      more on the alert, went back shivering to the fire in the dining-room.
      When they were seated again, Archie put a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think that policeman was dreaming?" he asked meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Random sharply. "I believe that the man who assaulted Mrs.
      Jasher is hanging about, and ventured back into the room, relying on the
      fog as a means of escape, should he be spotted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the man wouldn't be such a fool as to return into danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unless he wanted something very badly," said Random significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope let the cigarette he was lighting fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may be wrong, of course. But it is my impression that there is
      something in the parlor which this man wants, and for which he tried to
      murder Mrs. Jasher. We interrupted him, and he was forced to flee. Hidden
      in the fog, he is lurking about to see if he can't obtain what he has
      risked his neck to secure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can it be?" murmured Archie, struck by the feasibility of this
      theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps the second emerald," remarked Sir Frank grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! You don't think that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think anything. I am too tired to think at all. However, Painter
      will keep his eyes open, and in the morning we can search the room. The
      man has been in the house twice to get what he wanted. He won't risk
      another attempt, now that he is aware we are on the alert. I'm going to
      try and get forty winks. You keep watch, as you have had your sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope was quite agreeable, but just as Random composed himself to uneasy
      slumber, Jane, haggard and red-eyed, came hastily into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you please, gentlemen, the doctor wants you to come and see mistress.
      She is sensible, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two waited to hear no more, but went hastily but softly into the room
      wherein lay the dying woman. Robinson sat by the bedside, holding his
      patient's hand and feeling her pulse. He placed his finger on his lips as
      the men entered gently, and at the same moment Mrs. Jasher's voice, weak
      from exhaustion, sounded through the room, which was dimly illuminated by
      one candle. The newcomers halted in obedience to Robinson's signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is there?" asked Mrs. Jasher weakly, for, in spite of the care
      exercised, she had evidently heard the footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hope and Sir Frank Random," whispered the doctor, speaking into the
      dying woman's ear. "They came in time to save you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In time to see me die," she murmured; "and I can't die, unless I tell the
      truth. I am glad Random is there; he is a kind-hearted boy, and treated me
      better than he need have done. I&mdash;oh&mdash;some brandy&mdash;brandy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Robinson gave her some in a spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now lie quietly and do not attempt to speak," he commanded. "You need all
      your strength."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do&mdash;to tell that which I wish to tell," gasped Mrs. Jasher, trying
      to raise herself. "Sir Frank! Sir Frank!" Her voice sounded hoarse and
      weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mrs. Jasher," said the young man, coming softly to the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thrust out a weak hand and clutched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be my father-confessor, and hear all. You got the emerald?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" Random recoiled in astonishment, "Did you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I sent it to you as a wedding present. I was sorry and I was afraid;
      and I&mdash;I&mdash;" She paused again, gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor intervened and gave her more brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not talk," he insisted severely, "or I shall turn Sir Frank and
      Mr. Hope out of the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! Give me more brandy&mdash;more&mdash;more." and when the doctor
      placed a tumbler to her lips, she drank so greedily that he had to take
      the glass away lest she should do herself harm. But the ardent spirit put
      new life into her, and with a superhuman effort she suddenly reared
      herself in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, Hope&mdash;come here, Random," she said in a much stronger
      voice. "I have much to tell you. Yes, I took the emerald after dark and
      threw it into the sentry box when the man wasn't looking. I escaped your
      spy, Random, and I escaped the notice of the sentry. I walked like a cat,
      and like a cat I can see in the dark. I am glad you have got the emerald."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you get it?" asked Random quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a long story. I don't know that I have the strength to tell it. I
      have written it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have written it out?" said Hope quickly, and drawing near.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Jane thought that I was writing letters, but I was writing out the
      whole story of the murder. You were good to me, Random, you dear boy, and
      on the impulse of the moment I took the emerald to you. I was sorry when I
      got back, but it was too late then to repent, as I did not dare to go near
      the Fort again. Your spy who watched might have discovered me the second
      time. I then thought that I would write out the story of the murder, so as
      to exonerate myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are not guilty of Bolton's death?" asked Sir Frank, puzzled, for
      her confession was somewhat incoherent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I did not strangle him. But I know who did. I have written it all
      down. I was just finishing when I heard the tapping at the window. I let
      him in and he tried to get the confession, for I told him what I had
      done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who did you tell?" asked Hope, much excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jasher took no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The confession is lying on my desk&mdash;all the sheets of paper are
      loose. I had no time to bind them together, for he came in. He wanted the
      emerald, and the confession. I told him that I had given the emerald to
      you, Random, and that I had confessed all in writing. Then he went mad and
      flew at me with a dreadful knife. He knocked over the candles and the
      lamp. Everything went out and all was darkness, and I lay crying for help,
      with that devil stabbing&mdash;stabbing&mdash;ah&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, in heaven's name, is the man?" demanded Random, standing up in his
      eagerness. But Mrs. Jasher had fallen back in a faint, and Robinson was
      again supplying her with brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better leave the room, you two," he said, "or I can't be
      answerable for her life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must stay and learn the truth," said Random determinedly, "and you,
      Hope, go into the parlor and find that confession. It is on the desk, as
      she said, all loose sheets. No doubt it was the confession which the man
      she refers to tried to secure when he came back the second time. He may
      make another attempt, or Painter may go to sleep. Hurry! hurry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie needed no second telling, as he realized what hung on the securing
      of the confession. He stole swiftly out of the room, closing the door
      after him. Faint as was the sound, Mrs. Jasher heard it and opened her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not go, Random," she said faintly. "I have yet much to say, although
      the confession will tell you all. I am half sorry I wrote it out&mdash;at
      least I was&mdash;and perhaps should have burnt it had I not met with this
      accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accident!" echoed Sir Frank scornfully. "Murder you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sinister word galvanized the dying woman in sudden strong life, and
      she reared herself again on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murder! Yes, it is murder," she cried loudly. "He killed Sidney Bolton to
      get the emeralds, and he killed me to make me close my mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who stabbed you? Speak! speak!" cried Random anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cockatoo. He is guilty of my death and Bolton's," and she fell back,
      dead.

      CHAPTER XXV. THE MILLS OF GOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the cold gray hours of the morning, Hope and his friend left the
      cottage wherein such a tragedy had taken place. The dead woman was lying
      stiff and white on her bed under a winding sheet, which had already been
      strewn with many-hued chrysanthemums taken from the pink parlor by the
      weeping Jane. The wretched woman who had led so stormy and unhappy a life
      had at least one sincere mourner, for she had always been kind to the
      servant, who formed her entire domestic staff, and Jane would not hear a
      word said against the dead. Not that anyone did say anything; for Random
      and Hope kept the contents of the confession to themselves. There would be
      time enough for Mrs. Jasher's reputation to be smirched when those same
      contents were made public.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the poor woman died, Random left the doctor and the servant to look
      after the corpse, and went into the parlor. Here he met Hope with the
      confession in his hand. Luckily, Painter was not in the room at the
      moment, else he would have prevented the artist from taking away the same.
      Hope&mdash;as directed by Mrs. Jasher&mdash;had found the confession,
      written on many sheets, lying on the desk. It broke off abruptly towards
      the end, and was not signed. Apparently at this point Mrs. Jasher had been
      interrupted&mdash;as she had said&mdash;by the tapping of Cockatoo at the
      window. Probably she had admitted him at once, and on her refusal to give
      him the emerald, and on her confessing what she had written, he had
      overturned the lights for the purpose of murdering her. Only too well had
      the Kanaka succeeded in his wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie slipped the confession into his pocket before the policeman
      returned, and then left the cottage with Random and the doctor, since
      nothing else could now be done. It was between seven and eight, and the
      chilly dawn was breaking, but the sea-mist still lay heavily over the
      marshes, as though it were the winding sheet of the dead. Robinson went to
      his own house to get his trap and drive into Jessum, there to catch the
      train and ferry to Pierside. It was necessary that Inspector Date should
      be informed of this new tragedy without delay, and as Constable Painter
      was engaged in watching the cottage, there was no messenger available but
      Dr. Robinson. Random indeed offered to send a soldier, or to afford
      Robinson the use of the Fort telephone, but the doctor preferred to see
      Date personally, so as to detail exactly what had happened. Perhaps the
      young medical man had an eye to becoming better known, for the improvement
      of his practice; but he certainly seemed anxious to take a prominent part
      in the proceedings connected with the murder of Mrs. Jasher.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Robinson parted from them, Random and Hope went to the lodgings of
      the latter, so as to read over the confession and learn exactly to what
      extent Mrs. Jasher had been mixed up in the tragedy of the green mummy.
      She had declared herself innocent even on her death-bed, and so far as the
      two could judge at this point, she certainly had not actually strangled
      Sidney Bolton. But it might be&mdash;and it appeared to be more than
      probable&mdash;that she was an accessory after the fact. But this they
      could learn from the confession, and they sat in Hope's quiet little
      sitting-room, in which the fire had been just lighted by the artist's
      landlady, with the scattered sheets neatly ranged before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you would like a cup of coffee, or a whisky and soda," suggested
      Archie, "before starting to read?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should," assented Random, who looked weary and pale. "The events of the
      night have somewhat knocked me up. Coffee for choice&mdash;nice, black,
      strong, hot coffee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope nodded and went to order the same. When he returned he sat down,
      after closing the door carefully, and proceeded to read. But before he
      could speak Random raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us chat until the coffee comes in," he said; "then we shall not be
      interrupted when reading."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Hope. "Have a cigar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thanks. I have been smoking all the night. I shall sit here by the
      fire and wait for the coffee. You look chippy yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And small wonder," said Archie wearily. "We little thought when we left
      the Fort last night what a time we were going to have. Fancy Mrs. Jasher
      having sent you the emerald after all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. She repented, as she said, and yet I dare say&mdash;as she also said&mdash;she
      was sorry that she acted on her impulse. If she had not been stabbed by
      that damned Cockatoo, she would no doubt have destroyed that confession. I
      expect she wrote that also on the impulse of the moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She confessed as much," said Hope, leaning his head on his hand and
      staring into the fire. "She must have been cognizant of the truth all
      along. I wonder if she was an accessory before or after the fact?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I wonder," said Random, after a moment's thought, "is, what Braddock
      has to do with the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope raised his head in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, nothing. Mrs. Jasher did not say a word against Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that. All the same, Cockatoo was completely under the thumb of the
      Professor, and probably was instructed by him to strangle Bolton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is impossible," cried the artist, much agitated. "Think of what you
      are saying, Random. What a terrible thing it would be for Lucy if the
      Professor were guilty in such a way as you suggest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, I fail to see that. Miss Kendal is no relation to Braddock save
      by marriage. His iniquities have nothing to do with her, or with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's impossible, I tell you, Random. Throughout the whole of this
      case Braddock has acted in a perfectly innocent way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it," said Sir Frank caustically; "he has acted. In spite of
      his pretended grief for the loss of the emeralds, I should not be
      surprised to learn from that," he nodded towards the confession on the
      table, "that he was in possession of the missing gem. Cockatoo had no
      reason to steal the emeralds himself, setting aside the fact that he
      probably would not know their value, being but a semi-civilized savage. He
      acted under orders from his master, and although Cockatoo strangled
      Bolton, the Professor is really the author and the gainer and the moving
      spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would make Braddock an accessory before the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and Mrs. Jasher an accessory after the fact. Cockatoo is the link,
      as the actual criminal, who joins the two in a guilty partnership. No
      wonder Braddock intended to make that woman his wife even though he did
      not love her, for she knew a jolly sight too much for his peace of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is horrible," murmured Hope desperately; "but it is mere theory. We
      cannot be sure until we read the confession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll be sure soon, then, for here comes the coffee."
    </p>
    <p>
      This last remark Random made when a timid knock came to the door, and a
      moment later the landlady entered with a tray bearing cups, saucers, and a
      jug of steaming coffee. She was a meek, reticent woman who entered and
      departed in dismal silence, and in a few moments the two young men were
      quite alone with the door closed. They drank a cup of coffee each, and
      then Hope proceeded to read the confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story told by Mrs. Jasher commenced with a short account of her early
      life. It appeared that her father was a ruined gentleman and a gambler,
      and that her mother had been an actress. She was dragged up in a Bohemian
      sort of way until she attained a marriageable age, when her mother, who
      seemed to have been both wicked and hard-hearted, forced her to marry a
      comparatively wealthy man called Jasher. The elderly husband&mdash;for
      Jasher was not young&mdash;treated his wife very badly, and, infected with
      the spirit of gambling by her father, lost all his money. Mrs. Jasher then
      went with him to America and performed on the stage in order to keep the
      home together. She had one child, but it died, much to her grief, yet also
      much to her relief, as she was so miserable and poor. Mrs. Jasher gave a
      scanty account of sordid years of trouble and trial, of failure and
      sorrow. She and her husband roamed all over America, and then went to
      Australia and New Zealand, where they lived a wretched existence for many
      years. Finally the husband died of strong drink at an advanced age,
      leaving Mrs. Jasher a somewhat elderly widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman again took to the stage and tried to earn her bread, but
      was unsuccessful. Afterwards she lectured. Then she kept a boarding
      establishment, and finally went out as a nurse. In every way, it would
      seem, she tried to keep her head above water, and roamed the world like a
      bird of passage, finding rest nowhere for the sole of her foot. Yet
      throughout her story both the young men could see that she had always
      aspired to a quiet and decent, respectable existence, and that only force
      of circumstances had flung her into the whirlpool of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I said," remarked Random at this stage, "the miserable creature was
      more sinned against than sinning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her moral sense seemed to have become blunted, however," said Archie
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And small wonder, amidst such surroundings; but it seems to me that she
      was much better under the circumstances than many another woman would have
      been. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Melbourne Mrs. Jasher made a lucky speculation in mines, which brought
      her one thousand pounds. With this she came to England, and resolved to
      make a bid for respectability. Chance led her into the neighborhood of
      Gartley, and thinking that if she set up her tent in this locality she
      might manage to marry an officer from the Fort&mdash;since amidst such
      dismal surroundings a young man might be the more easily fascinated by a
      woman of the world&mdash;she took the cottage amidst the marshes at a
      small rent. Here she hoped to eke out what money she had left&mdash;a few
      hundreds&mdash;until the coveted marriage should take place. Afterwards
      she met Professor Braddock and determined to marry him, as a man more easy
      to manage. She was successful in enlisting Lucy on her side, and until the
      green mummy brought its bad luck to the Pyramids everything went
      capitally.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in connection with the name of Bolton that the first mention was
      made of the green mummy. Sidney was a clever young man, although very
      lowly born, and having been taken up by Professor Braddock as an
      assistant, could hope some day to make a position. Braddock was educating
      him, although he paid him very little in the way of wages. Sidney fell in
      love with Mrs. Jasher, and in some way&mdash;she did not mention how&mdash;gained
      her confidence. Perhaps the lonely woman was glad to have a sympathetic
      friend. At all events she told her past history to Sidney, and mentioned
      that she desired to marry Braddock. But Sidney insisted that she should
      marry him, and promised to make enough money to satisfy her that he was a
      good match, setting aside his humble birth, for which Mrs. Jasher cared
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Sidney related what he had discovered. Braddock, when in
      Peru many years before, had tried to get mummies for some scientific
      reason. When Hervey&mdash;then known as Vasa&mdash;promised to procure him
      the mummy of the last Inca, Braddock was extremely pleased. Hervey stole
      the mummy and also the copy of the manuscript which was written in Latin.
      He sent this latter to Braddock&mdash;who was then at Cuzco&mdash;as an
      earnest of his success in procuring the mummy, and when the Professor
      returned to Lima the mummy was to be handed to him. Unfortunately,
      Braddock was carried into captivity for one year, and when he escaped Vasa
      had disappeared with the mummy. As the Professor had deciphered the Latin
      manuscript, he knew of the emeralds, and for years had been hunting for
      the mummy&mdash;sure to be recognized from its peculiar green color&mdash;in
      order to get the jewels, and thus secure money for his Egyptian
      expedition. All through, it seems, the Professor was actuated by purely
      scientific enthusiasm, as in the abstract he cared very little for hard
      cash. Bolton told Mrs. Jasher that Braddock explained how much he desired
      to get the mummy, but he did not mention about the jewels. For a long time
      Sidney was under the impression that his master merely wanted the mummy to
      see the difference between the Egyptian and Peruvian modes of embalming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day Sidney chanced on the Latin manuscript, and learned that
      Braddock's real reason for getting the mummy was to procure the emeralds
      which were held in the grip of the dead. Sidney kept this knowledge to
      himself, and Braddock never guessed that his assistant knew the truth.
      Then unexpectedly Braddock stumbled across the advertisement describing
      the green mummy for sale in Malta. From the color he made sure that it was
      that of Inca Caxas, and so moved heaven and earth to get money to buy it.
      At length he did, from Archie Hope, on condition that he consented to the
      marriage of his step-daughter with the young man. Thinking that Sidney was
      ignorant of the jewels, he sent him to bring the mummy home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidney told Mrs. Jasher that he would try and steal the jewels in Malta or
      on board the tramp steamer. Failing that, he would delay the delivery of
      the mummy to Braddock on some excuse and rob it at Pierside. To make sure
      of escaping, he borrowed a disguise from his mother, alleging that Hope
      wanted the same to clothe a model. Sidney intended to take these clothes
      with him, and, after stealing the jewels, to escape disguised as an old
      woman. As he was slender and clean-shaven and a capital actor, he could
      easily manage this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he arranged that Mrs. Jasher should join him in Paris, and they would
      sell the emeralds, and go to America, there to marry and live happily ever
      afterwards, like a fairy tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for the success of this plan, Mrs. Jasher thought that the
      Professor would make a more distinguished husband, so she betrayed all
      that Sidney, had arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a beastly thing to do!" interrupted Random, disgusted. "It is not as
      if she wanted to help Braddock. I think less of Mrs. Jasher than ever I
      did. She might have remembered that there is honor amongst thieves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she is dead, poor soul!" said Hope with a sigh. "God knows that if
      she sinned, she has paid cruelly for her sin," after which remark, as Sir
      Frank was silent, he resumed his reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock was furious when he learned of his assistant's projected
      trickery, and he determined to circumvent him. He agreed to marry Mrs.
      Jasher, as, if he had not done so, she could have warned Sidney and he
      could have escaped with both the mummy and the jewels by conniving with
      Hervey. The Professor could not risk that, as, remembering Hervey as
      Gustav Vasa, he was aware how clever and reckless he was. Whether Braddock
      ever intended to marry the widow in the end it is hard to say, but he
      certainly pretended to consent to the engagement, which was mainly brought
      about by Lucy. Then came the details of the murder so far as Mrs. Jasher
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening&mdash;in fact on the evening when the crime was committed&mdash;the
      woman was walking in her garden late. In the moonlight she saw Braddock
      and Cockatoo go down along the cinderpath to the jetty near the Fort.
      Wondering what they were doing, she waited up, and heard and saw them&mdash;for
      it was still moonlight&mdash;come back long after midnight. The next day
      she heard of the murder, and guessed that the Professor and his slave&mdash;for
      Cockatoo was little else&mdash;had rowed up to Pierside in a boat and
      there had strangled Sidney and stolen the mummy. She saw Braddock and
      accused him. The Professor had then opened the case, and had pretended
      astonishment when discovering the corpse of the man whom Cockatoo had
      strangled, as he knew perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Braddock at first denied having been to Pierside, but Mrs. Jasher insisted
      that she would tell the police, so he was forced to make a clean breast of
      it to the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for it," said Random, settling himself to hear details of the crime,
      for he had often wondered how it had been executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Braddock," read Archie from the confession, for Mrs. Jasher did not
      trouble herself with a polite prefix&mdash;"Braddock explained that when
      he received a letter from Sidney stating that he would have to remain with
      the mummy for a night in Pierside, he guessed that his treacherous
      assistant intended to effect the robbery. It seems that Sidney by mistake
      had left behind the disguise in which he intended to escape. Aware of this
      through me"&mdash;Mrs. Jasher referred to herself&mdash;"he made Cockatoo
      assume the dress and row up the river to the Sailor's Rest. The Kanaka
      easily could be mistaken for a woman, as he also, like Sidney, was slender
      and smooth-chinned. Also, he wore the shawl over his head to disguise his
      mop of frizzy hair as much as possible, and for the purpose of concealing
      his tattooed face. In the darkness&mdash;it was after nine o'clock&mdash;he
      spoke to Sidney through the window, as he had seen him there earlier, when
      searching for him. Cockatoo said that Sidney was much afraid when he heard
      that his purpose had been discovered by the Professor. He offered a share
      of the plunder to the Kanaka, and Cockatoo agreed, saying he would come
      back late, and that Sidney was to admit him into the bedroom so that they
      could open the mummy and steal the jewels. Sidney quite believed that
      Cockatoo was heart and soul with him, especially as the cunning Kanaka
      swore that he was weary of his master's tyranny. It was when Cockatoo was
      talking thus that he was seen by Eliza Flight, who mistook him&mdash;very
      naturally&mdash;for a woman. Cockatoo then returned by boat to the Gartley
      jetty and told his master. Afterwards, the Professor, at a much later
      hour, went down to the jetty and was rowed up to Pierside by the Kanaka."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was when Mrs. Jasher saw them," said Random, much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Archie. "And then, if you remember; she watched for the return
      of the couple."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was nearly midnight when the boat was brought alongside the sloping
      stone bank of the alley which ran past the Sailor's Rest. No one was about
      at that hour, not even a policeman, and there was no light in Sidney
      Bolton's window. Braddock was much agitated as he thought that Sidney had
      already escaped. He waited in the boat and sent Cockatoo to knock at the
      window. Then a light appeared and the window was silently opened. The
      Kanaka slipped in and remained there for some ten minutes after closing
      the window. When he returned, the light was extinguished. He whispered to
      his master that Sidney had opened the packing case and the mummy coffin,
      and had ripped the swathings to get the jewels. When Sidney would not hand
      over the jewels to the Kanaka, as the latter wanted him to, Cockatoo,
      already prepared with the window cord, which he had silently taken from
      the blind, sprang upon the unfortunate assistant and strangled him.
      Cockatoo told this to his horrified master, and wanted him to come back to
      hide the corpse in the packing case. Braddock refused, and then Cockatoo
      told him that he would throw the jewels&mdash;which he had taken from
      Sidney's body&mdash;into the river. The position of master and servant was
      reversed, and Braddock was forced to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Professor slipped silently ashore and into the room. The two men
      relighted the candle and pulled down the blind. They then placed the
      corpse of Sidney in the packing case, and screwed the same down in
      silence. When this was completed, they were about to carry the mummy in
      its coffin&mdash;the lid of which they had replaced&mdash;to the boat,
      when they heard distant footsteps, probably those of a policeman on his
      beat. At once they extinguished the candle, and&mdash;as Braddock told
      Mrs. Jasher&mdash;he, for one, sat trembling in the dark. But the
      policeman&mdash;if the footsteps were those of a policeman&mdash;passed up
      another street, and the two were safe. Without relighting the candle, they
      silently slipped the mummy through the window, Cockatoo within and
      Braddock without. The case and its contents were not heavy, and it was not
      difficult for the two men to take it to the boat. When it was safely
      bestowed, Cockatoo&mdash;who was as cunning as the devil, according to his
      master returned to the bedroom, and unlocked the door. He afterwards
      passed a string through the joining of the upper and lower windows, and
      managed to shut the snib. Afterwards he came to the boat and rowed it back
      to Gartley. On the way Cockatoo told his master that Sidney had left
      instructions that the packing case should be taken next morning to the
      Pyramids, so there was nothing to fear. The mummy was hidden in a hole
      under the jetty and covered with grass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't they take it up to the house?" asked Random, on hearing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would have been dangerous," said Hope, looking up from the
      manuscript, "seeing that the mummy was supposed to have been stolen by the
      murderer. It was easier to hide it amongst the grasses under the jetty, as
      no one ever goes there. Well"&mdash;he turned over a few pages&mdash;"that
      is practically all. The rest is after events."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to hear them," said Random, taking another cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope ran his eyes swiftly over the remaining portion of the paper, and
      gave further details rapidly to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know all that happened," he said, "the Professor's pretended surprise
      when he found the corpse he had himself helped to pack and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! yes! But why was the mummy placed in Mrs. Jasher's garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was Braddock's idea. He fancied that the mummy might be found under
      the jetty and that inconvenient inquiries might be made. Also, he wished
      if possible to implicate Mrs. Jasher, so as to keep her from telling to
      the police what he had told her. He and Cockatoo went down to the river
      one night and removed the mummy to the arbor silently. Afterwards he
      pretended to be astonished when I found it. I must say he acted his part
      very well," said Hope reflectively, "even to accusing Mrs. Jasher. That
      was a bold stroke of genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very dangerous one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. He swore to Mrs. Jasher that if she said anything, he would
      tell the police that she had taken the clothes provided by Sidney from the
      Pyramids and had gone to speak through the window, in order to fly with
      Sidney and the emeralds. As the fact of the mummy being found in Mrs.
      Jasher's garden would lend color to the lie, she was obliged to hold her
      tongue. And after all, as she says, she didn't mind, since she was engaged
      to the Professor, and possessed at least one of the emeralds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! the one she passed along to me. How did she get that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope referred again to the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She insisted that Braddock should give it to her as a pledge of good
      faith. He had to do it, or risk her splitting. That was why he placed the
      mummy in her garden, so as to bring her into the matter, and render it
      more difficult for her to speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of the other emerald?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Braddock took that to Amsterdam, when he went to London that time&mdash;if
      you remember, when Don Pedro arrived. Braddock sold the emerald for three
      thousand pounds, and it is now on its way to an Indian rajah. I fear Don
      Pedro will never set eyes on that again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He banked it in a feigned name in Amsterdam, and intended to account for
      it when he married Mrs. Jasher by saying it was left to her by that
      mythical Pekin merchant brother of hers. Savvy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. What an infernal little villain! And I expect he sent Cockatoo down
      last night for the other emerald."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not related in the manuscript," said Archie, laying down the last
      sheet and taking up his coffee. "The confession ends abruptly&mdash;at the
      time Cockatoo tapped at the window, I expect. But she said, when dying,
      that the Kanaka asked for the second emerald. If she had not sent it to
      you in a fit of weakness, I expect she would have passed it along. I can't
      make out," added Archie musingly, "why Mrs. Jasher confessed when
      everything was so safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Random, nursing his chin, and staring into the fire, "she
      made a mistake in trying to blackmail me, though why she did so I can't
      tell, seeing she had the whiphand of Braddock. Perhaps she wanted the five
      thousand to spend herself, knowing that the Professor's plunder would be
      wasted on his confounded expedition. At any rate she gave herself away by
      the blackmail, and I expect she grew frightened. If the house had been
      searched&mdash;and it might have been searched by the police, had I
      arrested her for blackmail the emerald would have been found and she would
      have been incriminated. She therefore got rid of it cleverly, by passing
      it along to me as a wedding gift. Then she again grew afraid and wrote out
      this confession to exonerate herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it doesn't," insisted Hope. "She makes herself out plainly as an
      accessory after the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman doesn't understand these legal niceties. She wrote that out to
      clear herself in case she was arrested for the blackmail, and perhaps in
      case Braddock refused to help her&mdash;as he certainly did, if you
      remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was hard on her," confessed Archie slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Being such a villain himself," said Random grimly. "However, Cockatoo
      arrived unluckily on the scene, and when he found she had parted with the
      emerald, and had written out the truth, he stabbed her. If we hadn't come
      just in the nick of time, he would have annexed that confession, and the
      truth would never have become known. No one," ended Random, rising and
      stretching himself, "would connect Braddock or Cockatoo with the death of
      Mrs. Jasher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or with the death of Sidney Bolton either," said Hope, also rising and
      putting on his cap. "What an actor the man is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?" demanded Sir Frank, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the Pyramids. I want to see how Lucy is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you tell her about that confession?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until later. I shall give this to Inspector Date when he arrives. The
      Professor has made his bed, so he must lie on it. When I marry Lucy, I'll
      take her away from this damned place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry her at once, then," advised Random, "while the Professor is doing
      time, and while Cockatoo is being hanged. Meanwhile, I think you had
      better put on your overcoat, unless you want to walk through the village
      in crumpled evening dress, like a dissipated undergraduate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie laughed in spite of his weariness, and assumed his greatcoat at the
      same moment as Random slipped into his. The two young men walked out into
      the village and up to the Pyramids, for Random wished to see Braddock
      before returning to the Fort. They found the door of the great house open
      and the servants in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is all this?" demanded Hope, entering. "Why are you here, and not at
      work? Where is your master?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's run away," said the cook in a shrill voice. "Lord knows why, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Archie! Archie!" Lucy came running out of the museum, pale-faced and
      white, "my father has gone away with Cockatoo and the green mummy. What
      does it mean? And just when poor Mrs. Jasher is murdered too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, darling! Come in, and I'll explain," said Hope gently.

      CHAPTER XXVI. THE APPOINTMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Poor Lucy Kendal was terribly grieved and shocked when the full account of
      her step-father's iniquity was revealed to her. Archie tried to break the
      news as delicately as possible, but no words could soften the sordid
      story. Lucy, at first, could not believe it possible that a man, whom she
      had known for so long, and to whom she was related, would behave in such a
      base way. To convince her Hope was forced to let her read the account in
      Mrs. Jasher's handwriting. When acquainted with the contents, the poor
      girl's first desire was to have the matter hushed up, and she implored her
      lover with tears to suppress the damning document.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is impossible," said Hope firmly; "and if you think again, my dear,
      you will not repeat such a request. It is absolutely necessary that this
      should be placed in the hands of the police, and that the truth should
      become as widely known as possible. Unless the matter is settled once and
      for all, someone else may be accused of this murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the disgrace," wept Lucy, hiding her face on her lover's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped his arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling, the disgrace exists whether it be public or private. After
      all, the Professor is no relation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. But everyone knows that I am his step-daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everyone," echoed Archie, with an assumed lightness. "My dear, everyone
      in this instance only means the handful of people who live in this
      out-of-the-way village. Your name will not appear in the papers. And even
      if by chance it does, you will soon be changing it for mine. I think the
      best thing that can be done is for you to come with me to London next week
      and marry me. Then we can go to the south of France for the rest of the
      winter, until you recover. When we return and set up house in London&mdash;say
      in a year&mdash;the whole affair will be forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can you bear to marry me, when you know that I come of such a bad
      stock?" wept Lucy, a trifle more comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, must I remind you again that you are no relation to Professor
      Braddock; you have not a drop of his wicked blood in your veins. And even
      if you had, I should still marry you. It is you I love, and you I marry,
      so there is no more to be said. Come, darling, say that you will become my
      wife next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Professor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie smiled grimly. He found it difficult to forgive Braddock for the
      disgrace he had brought on the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think we'll ever be troubled again with the Professor," he said,
      after a pause. "He has bolted into the unknown with that infernal Kanaka."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why did he fly, Archie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he knew that the game was up. Mrs. Jasher wrote out this
      confession, and told Cockatoo, when he entered the room to get the
      emerald, that she had written it. To save his master the Kanaka stabbed
      the wretched woman, and, had Random and I not arrived, he would have
      secured the confession. I really believe he came back again out of the
      mist in the small hours of the morning to steal it. But when he found that
      all was vain, he returned here and told the Professor that the story of
      the murder had been written out. Therefore there was nothing left to
      Braddock but to fly. Although," added Hope, with an afterthought, "I can't
      imagine why those two fugitives should drag that confounded mummy with
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should the Professor fly?" asked Lucy again. "According to what
      Mrs. Jasher writes, he did not strangle poor Sidney."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. And I will do him the justice to say that he had no idea of having
      his assistant murdered. It was Cockatoo's savage blood which came out in
      the deed, and maybe it can be explained by the Kanaka's devotion to the
      Professor. It was the same way in the murder of Mrs. Jasher. By killing
      Bolton, the Kanaka hoped to save the emeralds for Braddock: in stabbing
      Mrs. Jasher, he hoped to save the Professor's life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Archie, will they hang my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call him your step-father," he said quickly. "No, dear, I do not think he
      will be hanged; but as an accessory after the fact he will certainly be
      condemned to a long term of imprisonment. Cockatoo, however, assuredly
      will be hanged, and a good job too. He is only a savage, and as such is
      dangerous in a civilized community. I wonder where they have gone? Did
      anyone hear them going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Lucy unhesitatingly. "Cook came up this morning to my room, and
      said that my father&mdash;I mean my step-father&mdash;had gone away with
      Cockatoo and with the green mummy. I don't know why she should have said
      that, as the Professor often went away unexpectedly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps she heard rumors in the village and put two and two together. I
      cannot tell. Some instinct must have told her. But I daresay Braddock and
      his accomplice fled under cover of the mist and in the small hours of the
      morning. They must have known that the confession would bring the officers
      of the law to this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope they will escape," murmured Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am not sure," said Hope hesitatingly. "Of course, I should like
      to avoid a scandal for your sake, and yet it is only right that the two of
      them should be punished. Remember, Lucy dear, how Braddock has acted all
      along in deceiving us. He knew all, and yet not one of us suspected him."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Archie was thus comforting the poor girl, Gartley village was in an
      uproar. Everyone was talking about this new crime, and everyone was
      wondering who had stabbed the unlucky woman. As yet the confession of Mrs.
      Jasher had not been placed in the hands of the police and everyone was
      ignorant that Cockatoo was the criminal who had escaped in the fog.
      Inspector Date speedily arrived with his myrmidons on the scene and made
      the cottage his headquarters. Later in the day, Hope, having taken a cold
      bath to freshen himself up, came with the confession. This he gave to the
      officer and explained the whole story of the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Date was more than astonished: he was astounded. He read the confession
      and made notes; then he sent for Sir Frank Random, and examined him in the
      same strict way as he had examined the artist. Jane was also questioned.
      Widow Anne was put in the witness box, so as to report about the clothes,
      and in every way Date gathered material for another inquest. At the former
      one he had only been able to place scanty evidence before the jury, and
      the verdict had been unsatisfactory to the public. But on this occasion,
      seeing that the witnesses he could bring forward would solve the mystery
      of the first death as well as the second, Inspector Date exulted greatly.
      He saw himself promoted and his salary raised, and his name praised in the
      papers as a zealous and clever officer. By the time the inquest came to be
      held, the inspector had talked himself into believing that the whole
      mystery had been solved by himself. But before that time came another
      event happened which astonished everyone, and which made the final phase
      of the green mummy crime even more sensational than it had been. And
      Heaven knows that from beginning to end there had been no lack of
      melodrama of the most lurid description.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro de Gayangos was exceedingly amazed at the unexpected turn which
      the case had taken. That he should have been trying to solve a deep
      mystery for so long, and that the solution, all the time, had been in the
      hands of the Professor, startled him exceedingly. He admitted that he had
      never liked Braddock, but explained that he had not expected to hear that
      the fiery little scientist was such a scoundrel. But, as Don Pedro
      confessed, it was an ill wind which blew him some good, when the upshot of
      the whole mysterious tragic business was the restoration of at least one
      emerald. Sir Frank brought the gem to him on the afternoon of the day
      succeeding Mrs. Jasher's death, and while the whole village was buzzing
      with excitement. It was Random who gave all details to Donna Inez and her
      father, leading from one revelation to another, until he capped the whole
      extraordinary story by producing the splendid gem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine! mine!" said Don Pedro, his dark eyes glittering. "Thanks be to the
      Virgin and the Saints," and he bowed his head to make the sign of the
      cross devoutly on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Inez clapped her hands and her eyes flashed, for, like every woman,
      she had a profound love for jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how lovely, Frank! It must be worth no end of money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Professor Braddock sold the other to some Indian rajah in Amsterdam&mdash;through
      an agent, I presume for three thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall get more than that," said Don Pedro quickly. "The Professor sold
      his jewel in a hurry and had no time to bargain. But sooner or later I
      shall get five thousand pounds for this." He held the gem in the sunlight,
      where it glowed like an emerald sun. "Why, it is worthy of a king's
      crown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear you will never get the other gem," said Random regretfully. "I
      believe that it is on its way to India, if Mrs. Jasher can be trusted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind. I shall be content with this one, senor. I have simple
      tastes, and this will do much to restore the fortunes of my family. When I
      go back with this and the green mummy, all those Indians who know of my
      descent from the ancient Incas will be delighted and will pay me fresh
      reverence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you forget," said Random, frowning, "the green mummy has been taken
      away by Professor Braddock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They cannot have gone far with it," said Donna Inez, shrugging.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know so much about that, dearest," said Sir Frank. "Apparently,
      since they handled it at the time of the murder, it is easier carried
      about than one would think. And then they fled last night, or rather in
      the small hours of this morning, under cover of a dense fog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is clear enough now," said De Gayangos, peering through the window,
      where a pale winter sun shone in a clear steel-hued sky. "They are bound
      to be caught in the long run."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish them to be caught?" asked Random abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the Professor. For Miss Lucy's sake I hope he will escape; but I
      trust that the savage who killed these two unfortunate people will be
      brought to the gallows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I," said Random. "Well, Don Pedro, it seems to me that your task in
      Gartley is ended. All you have to do is to wait for the inquest and see
      Mrs. Jasher buried, poor soul! Then you can go to London and remain there
      until after Christmas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should I remain in London?" asked the Peruvian, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random glanced at Donna Inez, who blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget that you have given your consent to my marriage with&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes," Don Pedro smiled gravely. "I return with the jewel to Lima, but
      I leave my other jewel behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," said the girl, kissing her father; "when Frank and I are
      married we will come to Callao in his yacht."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our yacht," said Random, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our yacht," repeated Donna Inez. "And then you will see, father, that I
      have become a real English lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't entirely forget that you are a Peruvian," said Don Pedro
      playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a descendant of Inca Caxas," added Donna Inez. Then she flirted her
      fan, which she was rarely without, and laughed in her English lover's
      face. "Don't forget, senor, that you marry a princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I marry the most charming girl in the world," he replied, catching her in
      his arms, rather to the scandal of De Gayangos, who had stiff Spanish
      notions regarding the etiquette of engaged couples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one thing you must do for me, senor," he said quietly, "before
      we leave this most unhappy case of murder and theft for ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?" asked Sir Frank, turning with Inez in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-night at eight o'clock, Captain Hervey&mdash;the sailor Gustav Vasa,
      if you prefer the name&mdash;steams down the river in his new boat The
      Firefly. I received a note from him"&mdash;he displayed a letter&mdash;"stating
      that he will pass the jetty of Gartley at that hour, and will burn a blue
      light. If I fire a pistol, he will send off a boat with a full account of
      the theft of the mummy of Inca Caxas, written by himself. Then I will hand
      his messenger fifty gold sovereigns, which I have here," added Don Pedro,
      pointing to a canvas bag on the table, "and we will return. I wish you to
      go with me, senor, and also I wish your friend Mr. Hope to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you anticipate treachery from Captain Hervey?" asked Random.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not be surprised if he tried to trick me in some way, and I wish
      you and your friend to stand by me. Were this man alone, I would go alone,
      but he will have a boat's crew with him. It is best to be safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree with you," said Random quickly. "Hope and I will come, and we
      will take revolvers with us. It doesn't do to trust this blackguard. Ho!
      ho! I wonder if he knows of the Professor's flight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Considering the terms upon which the Professor stood with Hervey, I
      should think he would be the last person he would trust. I wonder what has
      become of the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      More people than Don Pedro wondered as to the whereabouts of Braddock and
      his servant, for everyone was inquiring and hunting. The marshes round the
      cottage were explored: the great house itself was searched, as well as
      many cottages in the village, and inquiries were made at all the local
      stations. But all in vain. Braddock and Cockatoo, along with the
      cumbersome mummy in its case, had vanished as completely as though the
      earth had swallowed them up. Inspector Date's idea was that the pair had
      taken the mummy to Gartley Pier, after the search made by the soldiers,
      and there had launched the boat, which Cockatoo&mdash;judging from his
      visit to Pierside&mdash;apparently kept hidden in some nook. It was
      probable, said Date, the two had rowed down the river, and had managed to
      get on board some outward-bound tramp. They could easily furbish up some
      story, and as Braddock doubtless had money, could easily buy a passage for
      a large sum. The tramp being outward-bound, her captain and crew would
      know nothing of the crime, and even if the fugitives were suspected, they
      would be shipped out of England if the bribe was sufficiently large. So it
      was apparent that Inspector Date had not much opinion of tramp-steamer
      skippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as the day wore on to night, nothing was heard of Braddock or
      Cockatoo or the mummy, and when night came the village was filled with
      local reporters and with London journalists asking questions. The Warrior
      Inn did a great trade in drink and beds and meals, and the rustics reaped
      quite a harvest in answering questions about Mrs. Jasher and the Professor
      and the weird-looking Kanaka. Some reporters dared to invade the Pyramids,
      where Lucy was weeping in sorrow and shame, but Archie, reinforced by two
      policemen, sent to his aid by Date, soon sent them to the right about.
      Hope would have liked to remain with Lucy all the evening, but at
      half-past seven he was forced to meet Don Pedro and Random outside the
      Fort in order to go to Gartley Jetty.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. BY THE RIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the hunt for the fugitives had continued all day, everyone, police,
      villagers and soldiers, were weary and disheartened. Consequently, when
      the three men met near the Fort, there seemed to be few people about. This
      was just as well, as they would have been followed to the jetty, and
      obviously it was best to keep the strange meeting with Captain Hervey as
      secret as possible. However, Don Pedro had taken Inspector Date into his
      confidence, as it was impossible to get past the cottage of the late Mrs.
      Jasher, in which the officer had taken up his quarters, without being
      discovered. Date was quite willing that the trio should go, but stipulated
      that he should come also. He had heard all about Captain Hervey in
      connection with the mummy, and thought that he would like to ask that
      sailor a few leading questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I see fit I shall detain him until the inquest is over," said
      Date, which was mere bluff, as the inspector had no warrant to stop The
      Firefly or arrest her skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men therefore were joined by Date, when they came along the
      cinder path abreast of the cottage, and the quartette proceeded further
      immediately, walking amongst the bents and grasses to the rude old wooden
      jetty, near which Hervey intended to stop his ship. The night was quite
      clear of fog, strange to say, considering the late sea-mist; but a strong
      wind had been blowing all day and the fog-wreaths were entirely dispersed.
      A full moon rode amongst a galaxy of stars, which twinkled like diamonds.
      The air was frosty, and their feet scrunched the earth and grasses and
      coarse herbage under foot, as they made rapidly for the embankment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the top they could see the jetty clearly almost below
      their feet, and in the distance the glittering lights of Pierside. Vague
      forms of vessels at anchor loomed on the water, and there was a stream of
      light where the moon made a pathway of silver. After a casual glance the
      three men proceeded down the slope to the jetty. Three of them at least
      had revolvers, since Hervey was an ill man to tackle; but probably Date,
      who was too dense to consider consequences, was unarmed. Neither did Don
      Pedro think it necessary to tell the officer that he and his two
      companions were prepared to shoot if necessary. Inspector Date, being a
      prosy Englishman, would not have understood such lawless doings in his own
      sober, law-abiding country.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the jetty Don Pedro glanced at his watch, illuminating
      the dial by puffing his cigar to a ruddy glow. It was just after eight
      o'clock, and even as he looked an exclamation from Date made him raise his
      head. The inspector was pointing out-stream to a large vessel which had
      steamed inshore as far as was safe. Probably Hervey was watching for them
      through a night-glass, for a blue light suddenly flared on the bridge. Don
      Pedro, according to his promise, fired a pistol, and it was then that Date
      learned that his companions were armed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the devil did you do that for?" he inquired angrily. "It will bring
      my constables down on us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not mind, since you can control them," said De Gayangos coolly. "I
      had to give the signal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we all have revolvers," said Random quickly. "Hervey is not a very
      safe man to tackle, inspector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you expect a fight?" said Date, while they all watched a boat being
      lowered. "If so, you might have told me, and I should have brought a
      revolver also. Not that I think it is needed. The sight of my uniform will
      be enough to show this man that I have the law behind me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that will matter to Hervey," said Archie dryly. "So much as
      I have seen of him suggests to me that he is a singularly lawless man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Date laughed good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me, gentlemen, that you have brought me on a filibustering
      expedition," he said, and seemed to enjoy the novel situation. Date had
      been wrapped up in the cotton-wool of civilization for a long time, but
      his primitive instincts rose to the surface, now that he had to face a
      probable rough-and-tumble fight. "But I don't expect there will be any
      scrap," he said regretfully. "My uniform will settle the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly seemed to annoy Captain Hervey considerably, for, as the boat
      approached the shore, and the moonlight revealed a distinctly official
      overcoat, he gave an order. The man stopped rowing and the boat rocked
      gently, some distance from the jetty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got a high old crowd with you, Don Pedro," sang out Hervey, in
      great displeasure. "Is that angel in the military togs, with the brass
      buttons, the almighty aristocrat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I am here," cried out Random, laughing at the description, which he
      recognized. "My friend Hope is with me, and Inspector Date. I suppose you
      have heard what has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I've taken it all in," said Hervey sourly. "I guess the news is all
      over Pierside. Well, it's none of my picnic, I reckon. So chuck that gold
      over here, Don Pedro, and I'll send along the writing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Don Pedro, prompted by Date. "You must come ashore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess not," said Hervey vigorously. "You want to run me in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For that theft of thirty years ago," laughed De Gayangos. "Nonsense! Come
      along. You are quite safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shan't take your damned word for it," growled Hervey. "But if those two
      gents can swear that there's no trickery, I'll come. I can depend on the
      word of an English aristocrat, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along. You are quite safe," said Sir Frank, and Hope echoed his
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus being made certain, Hervey gave an order and the boat was rowed right
      up to the beach, immediately below the jetty. The four men were about to
      descend, but Hervey seemed anxious to avoid giving them trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on, gents," said he, leaping ashore. "I'll come up 'longside."
    </p>
    <p>
      Date, ever suspicious, thought it queer that the skipper should behave so
      politely, as he had gathered that Hervey was not usually a considerate
      man. Also, he saw that when the captain was climbing the bank, the boat,
      in charge of a mate&mdash;as the inspector judged from his brass-bound
      uniform&mdash;backed water to the end of the jetty, where it swung against
      one of the shell-encrusted piles. Hervey finally reached the jetty level,
      but refused to come on to the same. He beckoned to Don Pedro and his
      companions to walk forward to the ground upon which he was standing. Also,
      he seemed exceedingly anxious to take time over the transaction, as even
      after he had handed the scroll of writing to the Peruvian, and had
      received the gold in exchange, he engaged in quarrelsome conversation.
      Pretending that he doubted if De Gayangos had brought the exact sum, he
      opened the canvas bag and insisted on counting the money. Don Pedro
      naturally lost his temper at this insult, and swore in Spanish, upon which
      Hervey responded with such volubility that anyone could see he was a
      pastmaster in Castilian swearing. The row was considerable, especially as
      Random and Hope were laughing at the quarrel. They thought that Hervey was
      the worse for drink, but Date&mdash;clever for once in his life&mdash;did
      not think so. It appeared to him that the boat had gone to the end of the
      jetty for some reason connected with the same reason which induced the
      skipper to spin out the time of the meeting by indulging in an unnecessary
      quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skipper also kept his eyes about him, and insisted that the four men
      should keep together at the head of the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay you're trying to play low down on me," he said with a scowl,
      after satisfying himself that the money was correct, "but I've got my
      shooter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So have I," cried Don Pedro indignantly, and slipped his hand round to
      his hip pocket, "and if you talk any further so insulting I shall&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you bet, two can play at that game," cried Hervey, and ripped out his
      own weapon before the Spaniard could produce his Derringer. "Hands up or I
      shoot."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had reckoned without his host. While covering De Gayangos, he
      overlooked the fact that Random and Hope were close at hand. The next
      moment, and while Don Pedro flung up his hands, the ruffian was covered by
      two revolvers in the hands of two very capable men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Scott!" cried Hervey, lowering his weapon. "Only my fun, gents.
      Here, you get back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to Inspector Date, who had been keeping his ears and eyes open,
      and who was now racing for the end of the jetty. Peering over, he uttered
      a loud cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so&mdash;I thought so. Here's the nigger and the mummy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hervey uttered a curse, and, plunging past the trio, careless of the
      leveled weapons, ran down to the end of the jetty, and, throwing his arms
      round Date, leaped with him into the sea. They fell just beside the boat,
      as Random saw when he reached the spot. A confused volley of curses arose,
      as the boat pushed out from the encrusted pile, the mate thrusting with a
      boat-hook. Hervey and Date were in the water, but as the boat shot into
      the moonlight, Random&mdash;and now Hope and De Gayangos, who had come up&mdash;saw
      a long green form in amongst the sailors; also, very plainly, Cockatoo
      with his great mop of yellow hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoot! shoot!" yelled Date, who was struggling with the skipper in the
      shallow water near shore. "Don't let them escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope ran up the jetty and fired three shots in the air, certain that the
      firing would attract the attention of the four or five constables on guard
      at the cottage, which was no very great distance away. Random sent a
      bullet into the midst of the boatload, and immediately the mate fired
      also. The bullet whistled past his head, and, crazy with rage, he felt
      inclined to jump in amongst the ruffians and have a hand-to-hand fight.
      But De Gayangos stopped him in a voice shrill with anger. Already the
      shouts and noise of the approaching policemen could be heard. Cockatoo
      gripped the green mummy case desperately, while the sailors tried to row
      towards the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then De Gayangos gave a shout, and leaped, as the boat swung past the
      jetty. He landed right on Cockatoo, and although a cloud drifted across
      the moon, Random heard the shots coming rapidly from his revolver.
      Meanwhile Hervey got away from Date, as the constables came pounding down
      the jetty and on to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chuck the mummy and nigger overboard and make for the ship," he yelled,
      swimming with long strokes towards the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This order was quite to the sailors' minds, as they had not reckoned on
      such a fight. Half a dozen willing hands clutched both Cockatoo and the
      case, and, in spite of the Kanaka's cries, both were hurled overboard. As
      the case swung overside, De Gayangos, balancing himself at the end of the
      boat, fired at Cockatoo. The shot missed the Kanaka, and pierced the mummy
      case. Then from it came a piercing yell of agony and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great God!" shouted Hope, who was watching the battle, "I believe
      Braddock is in that damned thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment De Gayangos was swung overboard also, and the sailors were
      lifting Hervey into the boat. It nearly upset, but he managed to get in,
      and the craft rowed for the vessel, which was again showing a flaring blue
      light. Random sent a shot after the boat, and then with the policemen ran
      down to help De Gayangos, who was struggling in the water. He managed to
      pull him out, and when he had him safe and breathless on shore, he saw
      that the boat was nearing the ship, and that Date, torn and wet and
      disheveled, with three policemen, was up to his waist in water, struggling
      to bring ashore Cockatoo and the mummy case, to which he clung like a
      limpet. Hope ran down to give a hand, and in a few minutes they had the
      Kanaka ashore, fighting like the demon he was. Random and De Gayangos
      joined the breathless group, and Cockatoo was held in the grasp of two
      strong men&mdash;who required all their strength to hold him&mdash;while
      Date, warned by Hope's cry of what was in the case, tore at the lid. It
      was but lightly fastened and soon came off. Then those present saw in the
      moonlight the dead face of Professor Braddock, who had been shot through
      the heart. As they looked at the sight, Cockatoo broke from those who held
      him, and, throwing himself on his master, howled and wept as though his
      heart would break. At the same moment there came a derisive whistle from
      The Firefly, and they saw the great tramp steamer slowly moving down
      stream, increasing her speed with almost every revolution of the screw.
      Braddock had been captured, but Hervey had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the inquest on the Professor and on the body of Mrs. Jasher, it was
      proved that Cockatoo had warned his master that the game was up, and had
      suggested that Braddock should escape by hiding in the mummy case. The
      corpse of Inca Caxas was placed in an empty Egyptian sarcophagus&mdash;in
      which it was afterwards found&mdash;and Braddock, assisted by his faithful
      Kanaka, wheeled the case down to the old jetty. Here, in a nook where
      Cockatoo had formerly kept the boat, the Professor concealed himself all
      that night and all next day. Cockatoo, having got rid of his boat long
      since (lest it might be used in evidence against him and his master), ran
      through the dense mist and the long night up to Pierside, where he saw
      Captain Hervey and bribed him with a promise of one thousand pounds to
      save his master. Hervey, having assured himself that the money was safe,
      since it was banked in a feigned name in Amsterdam, agreed, and arranged
      to ship the Professor in the mummy case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that Hervey kept the four men talking up the jetty, as he knew
      that Cockatoo with his own sailors was shipping the Professor in the mummy
      case underneath, and well out of sight. Cockatoo had come down stream with
      The Firefly, and in this way had not been discovered. Throughout that long
      day the miserable Braddock had crouched like a toad in its hole, trembling
      at every sound of pursuit, as he knew that the whole of the village was
      looking for him. But Cockatoo had hidden him well in the case, in the lid
      of which holes had been bored. He had brandy to drink and food to eat, and
      he knew that he could depend upon the Kanaka. Had Date not been
      suspicious, the ruse might have been successful, but to save himself
      Hervey had to sacrifice the wretched Professor, which he did without the
      slightest hesitation. Then came the unlucky shot from the revolver of De
      Gayangos, which had ended Braddock's wicked life. It was Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the inquest a verdict of "wilful murder" was brought against the
      Kanaka, but a verdict of "justifiable homicide" was given in favor of the
      Peruvian. Thus Cockatoo was hanged for the double murder and Don Pedro
      went free. He remained long enough in London to see his daughter married
      to the man of her choice, and then returned to Lima.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the affair caused more than a nine days' wonder, and the
      newspapers were filled with accounts of the murder and the projected
      escape. But Lucy was saved from all this publicity, as, in the first
      place, her name was kept out of print as much as possible, and, in the
      second, Archie promptly married her, and within a fortnight of her
      step-father's death took her to the south of France, and afterwards to
      Italy. What with his own money and the money she inherited from her mother&mdash;in
      which Braddock had a life interest&mdash;the young couple had nearly a
      thousand a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months later Sir Frank came into the small San Remo where Mr. and Mrs.
      Hope lived, with his wife on his arm. Lady Random looked singularly
      charming and was assuredly more conversational. This was the first time
      the two sets of lovers had met since the tragedy, and now each girl had
      married the man she loved. Therefore there was great joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My yacht is over at Monte Carlo," said Random, "and I am, going with Inez
      to South America. She wants to see her father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do," said Lady Random; "and we want you to come also, Lucy&mdash;you
      and your dear husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie and his wife looked at one another, but declined unanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We would rather stay here in San Remo," said Mrs. Hope, becoming slightly
      pale. "Don't think me unkind, Inez, but I could not bear to go to Peru. It
      is associated too much in my own mind with that terrible green mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Don Pedro has taken that back to the Andes," explained Sir Frank,
      "and it is now reposing in the sepulchre in which it was placed, hundreds
      of years ago, by the Indians, faithful to Inca Caxas. Inez and I are going
      up to a kind of forbidden city, where Don Pedro reigns as Inca, and I
      expect we shall have a jolly time. I hear there is some big game shooting
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about your soldiering?" asked Hope, rather, surprised at this
      extended tour being arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my husband has left the army," pouted Inez. "His duties kept him away
      from me nearly all the day, and I grew weary of being left alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see, Mrs. Hope," laughed Random gayly, "that I have had to succumb
      to my fireside tyrant. We shall go and see this fairy city and then return
      to my home in Oxfordshire. There Inez will settle down as a real English
      wife and I'll turn a country squire. So, after all our troubles, peace
      will come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as you will not come to my country," said Lady Random to her hostess,
      "you cannot refuse to visit Frank and myself at the Grange. We have had so
      much trouble together that we cannot lose sight of each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Lucy, kissing her. "We will come to Oxfordshire."
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was arranged, and the next day Mr. and Mrs. Hope went over to Monte
      Carlo to see the last of Sir Frank and his wife. They stood on the heights
      watching the pretty little steamer making for South America. Archie
      noticed that his wife's face was somewhat sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sorry we did not go, sweetheart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she replied, placing her arm within his own. "I only want to be with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all right." He patted her hand. "Now that we have sold all the
      furniture in the Pyramids, and have got rid of the lease, there will be
      nothing to remind you of the green mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet I can't help thinking of my unfortunate step-father, and of poor Mrs.
      Jasher, and of Sidney Bolton. Oh, Archie, little as we can afford it, I am
      glad that we allow Mrs. Bolton a small sum a year. After all, it was
      through my step-father that her son met with his death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite agree with you, dear. Cockatoo's innate savagery was the
      cause, as Professor Braddock did not intend or desire murder. But there,
      dear, do not think any more about these dismal things. Dream of the time
      when I shall be the president of the Royal Academy, and you my lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am your lady now. But," added Lucy, perhaps from an association of
      ideas of color and the Academy, "I shall hate green for the rest of my
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's unlucky, considering it is Nature's color. My dear, in a year or
      two this tragedy, or rather the three tragedies, will seem like a dream. I
      won't listen to another word now. The green mummy has passed out of our
      lives and has taken its bad luck with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen, so be it," said Lucy Hope, and the happy couple went home, leaving
      all their sorrows behind them, while the smoke of the steamer faded on the
      horizon.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
